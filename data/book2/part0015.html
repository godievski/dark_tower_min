    <p class="para-flush">The time following that night was broken time for Roland, time that didn’t really exist as time at all. What he remembered was only a series of images, moments, conversation without context; images flashing past like one-eyed jacks and treys and nines and the Bloody Black Bitch Queen of Spiders in a card-sharp’s rapid shuffle.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Later on he asked Eddie how long that time lasted, but Eddie didn’t know either. Time had been destroyed for both of them. There was no time in hell, and each of them was in his own private hell: Roland the hell of the fever and infection, Eddie the hell of withdrawal.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“It was less than a week,” Eddie said. “That’s all I know for sure.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“How do you know that?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“A week’s worth of pills was all I had to give you. After that, you were gonna have to do the one thing or the other on your own.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Get well or die.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Right.”</p>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush">There’s a gunshot as twilight draws down to dark, a dry crack impinging on the inevitable and ineluctable sound of the breakers dying on the desolate beach: <i class="calibre">KA-BLAM!</i> He smells a whiff of gunpowder. <a id="page-158"></a><i class="calibre">Trouble,</i> the gunslinger thinks weakly, and gropes for revolvers that aren’t there. <i class="calibre">Oh no, it’s the end, it’s . . .</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">But there’s no more. as something starts to smell</p>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush">good in the dark. Something, after all this long dark dry time, something is <i class="calibre">cooking.</i> It’s not just the smell. He can hear the snap and pop of twigs, can see the faint orange flicker of a campfire. Sometimes, when the sea-breeze gusts, he smells fragrant smoke as well as that mouth-watering other smell. <i class="calibre">Food,</i> he thinks. <i class="calibre">My God, am I hungry? If I’m hungry, maybe I’m getting well.</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">Eddie,</i> he tries to say, but his voice is all gone. His throat hurts, hurts so bad. <i class="calibre">We should have brought some</i> astin, <i class="calibre">too,</i> he thinks, and then tries to laugh: all the drugs for him, none for Eddie.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie appears. He’s got a tin plate, one the gunslinger would know anywhere: it came, after all, from his own purse. On it are streaming chunks of whitish-pink meat.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">What?</i> he tries to ask, and nothing comes out but a squeaky little farting sound.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie reads the shape of his lips. “<i class="calibre">I</i> don’t know,” he says crossly. “All I know is it didn’t kill me. Eat it, damn you.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">He sees Eddie is very pale, Eddie is shaking, and he smells something coming from Eddie that is either shit or death, and he knows Eddie is in a bad way. He reaches out a groping hand, wanting to give comfort. Eddie strikes it away.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I’ll feed you,” he says crossly. “Fucked if I know why. I ought to kill you. I would, if I didn’t think that if you could get through into my world once, maybe you could do it again.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie looks around.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“And if it wasn’t that I’d be alone. Except for <i class="calibre">them.</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">He looks back at Roland and a fit of shuddering runs through him—it is so fierce that he almost spills the chunks of meat on the tin plate. At last it passes.</p><a id="page-159"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">“Eat, God damn you.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger eats. The meat is more than not bad; the meat is delicious. He manages three pieces and then everything blurs into a new</p>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush">effort to speak, but all he can do is whisper. The cup of Eddie’s ear is pressed against his lips, except every now and then it shudders away as Eddie goes through one of his spasms. He says it again. “North. Up . . . up the beach.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“How do you know?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Just know,” he whispers.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie looks at him. “You’re crazy,” he says.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger smiles and tries to black out but Eddie slaps him, slaps him hard. Roland’s blue eyes fly open and for a moment they are so alive and electric Eddie looks uneasy. Then his lips draw back in a smile that is mostly snarl.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Yeah, you can drone off,” he said, “but first you gotta take your dope. It’s time. Sun says it is, anyway. I guess. I was never no Boy Scout, so I don’t know for sure. But I guess it’s close enough for Government work. Open wide, Roland. Open wide for Dr. Eddie, you kidnapping fuck.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger opens his mouth like a baby for the breast. Eddie puts two of the pills in his mouth and then slops fresh water carelessly into Roland’s mouth. Roland guesses it must be from a hill stream somewhere to the east. It might be poison; Eddie wouldn’t know fair water from foul. On the other hand, Eddie seems fine himself, and there’s really no choice, is there? No.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">He swallows, coughs, and nearly strangles while Eddie looks at him indifferently.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland reaches for him.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie tries to draw away.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger’s bullshooter eyes command him.</p><a id="page-160"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland draws him close, so close he can smell the stink of Eddie’s sickness and Eddie can smell the stink of his; the combination sickens and compels them both.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Only two choices here,” Roland whispers. “Don’t know how it is in your world, but only two choices here. Stand and maybe live, or die on your knees with your head down and the stink of your own armpits in your nose. Nothing . . .” He hacks out a cough. “Nothing to me.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Who are you?”</i> Eddie screams at him.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Your destiny, Eddie,” the gunslinger whispers.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Why don’t you just eat shit and die?” Eddie asks him. The gunslinger tries to speak, but before he can he floats off as the cards</p>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush"><i class="calibre">KA-BLAM!</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland opens his eyes on a billion stars wheeling through the blackness, then closes them again.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">He doesn’t know what’s going on but he thinks everything’s okay. The deck’s still moving, the cards still</p>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush">More of the sweet, tasty chunks of meat. He feels better. Eddie looks better, too. But he also looks worried.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“They’re getting closer,” he says. “They may be ugly, but they ain’t completely stupid. They know what I been doing. Somehow they know, and they don’t dig it. Every night they get a little closer. It might be smart to move on when daybreak comes, if you can. Or it might be the last daybreak we ever see.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“What?” This is not exactly a whisper but a husk somewhere between a whisper and real speech.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Them,”</i> Eddie says, and gestures toward the beach. “<i class="calibre">Dad-a-chack, dum-a-chum,</i> and all that shit. I think they’re like us, Roland—all for eating, but not too big on getting eaten.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Suddenly, in an utter blast of horror, Roland realizes what the whitish-pink chunks of meat Eddie has been feeding him have been. He cannot speak; revulsion robs him of what little voice he has managed to get back. But Eddie sees everything he wants to say on his face.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“What did you think I was doing?” he nearly snarls. “Calling Red Lobster for take-out?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“They’re poison,” Roland whispers. “That’s why—”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Yeah, that’s why you’re <i class="calibre">hors de combat.</i> What I’m trying to keep from you being, Roland my friend, is <i class="calibre">hors d’oeuvres</i> as well. As far as poison goes, rattlesnakes are poison, but people eat them. Rattlesnake tastes real good. Like chicken. I read that somewhere. They looked like lobsters to me, so I decided to take a chance. What else were we gonna eat? Dirt? I shot one of the fuckers and cooked the living Christ out of it. There wasn’t anything else. And actually, they taste pretty good. I been shooting one a night just after the sun starts to go down. They’re not real lively until it gets completely dark. I never saw you turning the stuff down.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie smiles.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I like to think maybe I got one of the ones that ate Jack. I like to think I’m eating that dink. It, like, eases my mind, you know?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“One of them ate part of me, too,” the gunslinger husks out. “Two fingers, one toe.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“That’s also cool,” Eddie keeps smiling. His face is pallid, sharklike . . . but some of that ill look has gone now, and the smell of shit and death which has hung around him like a shroud seems to be going away.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Fuck yourself,” the gunslinger husks.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Roland shows a flash of spirit!” Eddie cries. “Maybe you ain’t gonna die after all! Dahling! I think that’s <i class="calibre">mah-vellous!</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Live,” Roland says. The husk has become a whisper again. The fishhooks are returning to his throat.</p><a id="page-162"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">“Yeah?” Eddie looks at him, then nods and answers his own question. “Yeah. I think you mean to. Once I thought you were going and once I thought you were gone. Now it looks like you’re going to get better. The antibiotics are helping, I guess, but mostly I think you’re <i class="calibre">hauling</i> yourself up. What for? Why the fuck do you keep trying so hard to keep alive on this scuzzy beach?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">Tower,</i> he mouths, because now he can’t even manage a husk.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You and your fucking Tower,” Eddie says, starts to turn away, and then turns back, surprised, as Roland’s hand clamps on his arm like a manacle.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">They look into each other’s eyes and Eddie says, “All right. All <i class="calibre">right!</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">North,</i> the gunslinger mouths. <i class="calibre">North, I told you.</i> Has he told him that? He thinks so, but it’s lost. Lost in the shuffle.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“How do you <i class="calibre">know?</i>” Eddie screams at him in sudden frustration. He raises his fists as if to strike Roland, then lowers them.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">I just know—so why do you waste my time and energy asking me foolish questions?</i> he wants to reply, but before he can, the cards</p>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush">being dragged along, bounced and bumped, his head lolling helplessly from one side to the other, bound to some kind of a weird <i class="calibre">travois</i> by his own gunbelts, and he can hear Eddie Dean singing a song which is so weirdly familiar he at first believes this must be a delirium dream:</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Heyy Jude . . . don’t make it bad . . . take a saaad song . . . and make it better . . .”</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">Where did you hear that?</i> he wants to ask. <i class="calibre">Did you hear me singing it, Eddie? And where are we?</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">But before he can ask anything</p><a id="page-163"></a>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush"><i class="calibre">Cort would bash the kid’s head in if he saw that contraption,</i> Roland thinks, looking at the <i class="calibre">travois</i> upon which he has spent the day, and laughs. It isn’t much of a laugh. It sounds like one of those waves dropping its load of stones on the beach. He doesn’t know how far they have come, but it’s far enough for Eddie to be totally bushed. He’s sitting on a rock in the lengthening light with one of the gunslinger’s revolvers in his lap and a half-full water-skin to one side. There’s a small bulge in his shirt pocket. These are the bullets from the back of the gunbelts—the diminishing supply of “good” bullets. Eddie has tied these up in a piece of his own shirt. The main reason the supply of “good” bullets is diminishing so fast is because one of every four or five has also turned out to be a dud.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie, who has been nearly dozing, now looks up. “What are you laughing about?” he asks.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger waves a dismissive hand and shakes his head. Because he’s wrong, he realizes. Cort wouldn’t bash Eddie for the <i class="calibre">travois,</i> even though it was an odd, lame-looking thing. Roland thinks it might even be possible that Cort might grunt some word of compliment—such a rarity that the boy to whom it happened hardly ever knew how to respond; he was left gaping like a fish just pulled from a cook’s barrel.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The main supports were two cottonwood branches of approximately the same length and thickness. A blowdown, the gunslinger presumed. He had used smaller branches as supports, attaching them to the support poles with a crazy conglomeration of stuff: gunbelts, the glue-string that had held the devil-powder to his chest, even the rawhide thong from the gunslinger’s hat and his, Eddie’s, own sneaker laces. He had laid the gunslinger’s bedroll over the supports.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Cort would not have struck him because, sick as he was, Eddie had at least done more than squat on his hunkers and bewail his fate. He had made <i class="calibre">something.</i> Had <i class="calibre">tried.</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">And Cort might have offered one of his abrupt, almost grudging <a id="page-164"></a>compliments because, crazy as the thing looked, it <i class="calibre">worked.</i> The long tracks stretching back down the beach to a point where they seemed to come together at the rim of perspective proved that.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You see any of them?” Eddie asks. The sun is going down, beating an orange path across the water, and so the gunslinger reckons he has been out better than six hours this time. He feels stronger. He sits up and looks down to the water. Neither the beach nor the land sweeping to the western slope of the mountains have changed much; he can see small variations of landscape and detritus (a dead seagull, for instance, lying in a little heap of blowing feathers on the sand about twenty yards to the left and thirty or so closer to the water), but these aside, they might as well be right where they started.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“No,” the gunslinger says. Then: “Yes. There’s one.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">He points. Eddie squints, then nods. As the sun sinks lower and the orange track begins to look more and more like blood, the first of the lobstrosities come tumbling out of the waves and begin crawling up the beach.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Two of them race clumsily toward the dead gull. The winner pounces on it, rips it open, and begins to stuff the rotting remains into its maw. <i class="calibre">“Did-a-chick?”</i> it asks.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Dum-a-chum?”</i> responds the loser. <i class="calibre">“Dod-a—”</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">KA-BLAM!</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland’s gun puts an end to the second creature’s questions. Eddie walks down to it and grabs it by the back, keeping a wary eye on its fellow as he does so. The other offers no trouble, however; it is busy with the gull. Eddie brings his kill back. It is still twitching, raising and lowering its claws, but soon enough it stops moving. The tail arches one final time, then simply drops instead of flexing downward. The boxers’ claws hang limp.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Dinnah will soon be served, mawster,” Eddie says. “You have your choice: filet of creepy-crawler or filet of creepy-crawler. Which strikes your fancy, mawster?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I don’t understand you,” the gunslinger said.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Sure you do,” Eddie said. “You just don’t have any sense of humor. What happened to it?”</p><a id="page-165"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">“Shot off in one war or another, I guess.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie smiles at that. “You look and sound a little more alive tonight, Roland.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I am, I think.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Well, maybe you could even walk for awhile tomorrow. I’ll tell you very frankly, my friend, dragging you is the pits and the shits.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I’ll try.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You do that.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You look a little better, too,” Roland ventures. His voice cracks on the last two words like the voice of a young boy. <i class="calibre">If I don’t stop talking soon,</i> he thought, <i class="calibre">I won’t be able to talk at all again.</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I guess I’ll live.” He looks at Roland expressionlessly. “You’ll never know how close it was a couple of times, though. Once I took one of your guns and put it against my head. Cocked it, held it there for awhile, and then took it away. Eased the hammer down and shoved it back in your holster. Another night I had a convulsion. I think that was the second night, but I’m not sure.” He shakes his head and says something the gunslinger both does and doesn’t understand. “Michigan seems like a dream to me now.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Although his voice is down to that husky murmur again and he knows he shouldn’t be talking at all, the gunslinger has to know one thing. “What stopped you from pulling the trigger?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Well, this is the only pair of pants I’ve got,” Eddie says. “At the last second I thought that if I pulled the trigger and it was one of those dud shells, I’d never get up the guts to do it again . . . and once you shit your pants, you gotta wash ’em right away or live with the stink forever. Henry told me that. He said he learned it in Nam. And since it was nighttime and Lester the Lobster was out, not to mention all his friends—”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">But the gunslinger is laughing, laughing hard, although only an occasional cracked sound actually escapes his lips. Smiling a little himself, Eddie says: “I think maybe you only got your sense of humor shot off up to the elbow in that war.” He gets up, meaning to go up the slope to where there will be fuel for a fire, Roland supposes.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Wait,” he whispers, and Eddie looks at him. “Why, really?”</p><a id="page-166"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">“I guess because you needed me. If I’d killed myself, you would have died. Later on, after you’re really on your feet again, I may, like, re-examine my options.” He looks around and sighs deeply.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“There may be a Disneyland or Coney Island somewhere in your world, Roland, but what I’ve seen of it so far really doesn’t interest me much.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">He starts away, pauses, and looks back again at Roland. His face is somber, although some of the sickly pallor has left it. The shakes have become no more than occasional tremors.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Sometimes you really don’t understand me, do you?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“No,” the gunslinger whispers. “Sometimes I don’t.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Then I’ll elucidate. There are people who need people to need them. The reason you don’t understand is because you’re not one of those people. You’d use me and then toss me away like a paper bag if that’s what it came down to. God fucked you, my friend. You’re just smart enough so it would hurt you to do that, and just hard enough so you’d go ahead and do it anyway. You wouldn’t be able to help yourself. If I was lying on the beach there and screaming for help, you’d walk over me if I was between you and your goddam Tower. Isn’t that pretty close to the truth?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland says nothing, only watches Eddie.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“But not everyone is like that. There are people who need people to need them. Like the Barbra Streisand song. Corny, but true. It’s just another way of being hooked through the bag.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie gazes at him.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“But when it comes to that, you’re clean, aren’t you?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland watches him.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Except for your Tower.” Eddie utters a short laugh. “You’re a Tower junkie, Roland.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Which war was it?” Roland whispers.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“What?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“The one where you got your sense of nobility and purpose shot off?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie recoils as if Roland has reached out and slapped him.</p><a id="page-167"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">“I’m gonna go get some water,” he says shortly. “Keep an eye on the creepy crawlers. We came a long way today, but I still don’t know if they talk to each other or not.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">He turns away then, but not before Roland has seen the last red rays of sunset reflected on his wet cheeks.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland turns back to the beach and watches. The lobstrosities crawl and question, question and crawl, but both activities seem aimless; they have some intelligence, but not enough to pass on information to others of their kind.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">God doesn’t always dish it in your face,</i> Roland thinks. <i class="calibre">Most times, but not always.</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie returns with wood.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Well?” he asks. “What do you think?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“We’re all right,” the gunslinger croaks, and Eddie starts to say something but the gunslinger is tired now and lies back and looks at the first stars peeking through the canopy of violet sky and</p>

    <h3 class="sub"><b class="calibre1">shuffle</b></h3>

    <p class="para-flush">in the three days that followed, the gunslinger progressed steadily back to health. The red lines creeping up his arms first reversed their direction, then faded, then disappeared. On the next day he sometimes walked and sometimes let Eddie drag him. On the day following he didn’t need to be dragged at all; every hour or two they simply sat for a period of time until the watery feeling went out of his legs. It was during these rests and in those times after dinner had been eaten but before the fire had burned all the way down and they went to sleep that the gunslinger heard about Henry and Eddie. He remembered wondering what had happened to make their brothering so difficult, but after Eddie had begun, haltingly and with that sort of resentful anger that proceeds from deep pain, the gunslinger could have stopped him, could have told him: <i class="calibre">Don’t bother, Eddie. I understand everything.</i></p><a id="page-168"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">Except that wouldn’t have helped Eddie. Eddie wasn’t talking to help Henry because Henry was dead. He was talking to bury Henry for good. And to remind himself that although Henry was dead, he, Eddie, wasn’t.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">So the gunslinger listened and said nothing.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gist was simple: Eddie believed he had stolen his brother’s life. Henry also believed this. Henry might have believed it on his own or he might have believed it because he so frequently heard their mother lecturing Eddie on how much both she and Henry had sacrificed for him, so Eddie could be as safe as anyone could be in this jungle of a city, so he could be <i class="calibre">happy,</i> as happy as anyone could be in this jungle of a city, so he wouldn’t end up like his poor sister that he didn’t even hardly remember but she had been so beautiful, God love her. She was with the angels, and that was undoubtedly a wonderful place to be, but she didn’t want Eddie to be with the angels just yet, run over in the road by some crazy drunken driver like his sister or cut up by some crazy junkie kid for the twenty-five cents in his pocket and left with his guts running out all over the sidewalk, and because she didn’t think <i class="calibre">Eddie</i> wanted to be with the angels yet, he just better listen to what his big brother said and do what his big brother said to do and always remember that Henry was making a love-sacrifice.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie told the gunslinger he doubted if his mother knew some of the things they had done—filching comic books from the candy store on Rincon Avenue or smoking cigarettes behind the Bonded Electroplate Factory on Cohoes Street.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Once they saw a Chevrolet with the keys in it and although Henry barely knew how to drive—he was sixteen then, Eddie eight—he had crammed his brother into the car and said they were going to New York City. Eddie was scared, crying, Henry scared too and mad at Eddie, telling him to shut up, telling him to stop being such a fuckin baby, he had ten bucks and Eddie had three or four, they could go to the movies all fuckin day and then catch a Pelham train and be back before their mother had time to put supper on the table and wonder where they were. But Eddie kept crying and near the Queensboro Bridge they saw a police car on a side street and although Eddie was <a id="page-169"></a>pretty sure the cop in it hadn’t even been looking their way, he said <i class="calibre">Yeah</i> when Henry asked him in a harsh, quavering voice if Eddie thought that bull had seen them. Henry turned white and pulled over so fast that he had almost amputated a fire hydrant. He was running down the block while Eddie, now in a panic himself, was still struggling with the unfamiliar doorhandle. Henry stopped, came back, and hauled Eddie out of the car. He also slapped him twice. Then they had walked—well, actually they <i class="calibre">slunk</i>—all the way back to Brooklyn. It took them most of the day, and when their mother asked them why they looked so hot and sweaty and tired out, Henry said it was because he’d spent most of the day teaching Eddie how to go one-on-one on the basketball court at the playground around the block. Then some big kids came and they had to run. Their mother kissed Henry and beamed at Eddie. She asked him if he didn’t have the bestest big brother in the world. Eddie agreed with her. This was honest agreement, too. He thought he did.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“He was as scared as I was that day,” Eddie told Roland as they sat and watched the last of the day dwindle from the water, where soon the only light would be that reflected from the stars. “Scareder, really, because he thought that cop saw us and I knew he didn’t. That’s why he ran. But he came back. That’s the important part. <i class="calibre">He came back.</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland said nothing.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You see that, don’t you?” Eddie was looking at Roland with harsh, questioning eyes.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I see.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“He was always scared, but he always came back.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland thought it would have been better for Eddie, maybe better for both of them in the long run, if Henry had just kept showing his heels that day . . . or on one of the others. But people like Henry never did. People like Henry always came back, because people like Henry <i class="calibre">did</i> know how to use. First they changed trust into need, then they changed need into a drug, and once that was done, they—what was Eddie’s word for it?—<i class="calibre">push.</i> Yes. They pushed it.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I think I’ll turn in,” the gunslinger said.</p><a id="page-170"></a>

    <p class="pause-space"></p>

    <p class="para-flush">The next day Eddie went on, but Roland already knew it all. Henry hadn’t played sports in high school because Henry couldn’t stay after for practice. Henry had to take care of Eddie. The fact that Henry was scrawny and uncoordinated and didn’t much care for sports in the first place had nothing to do with it, of course; Henry would have made a <i class="calibre">wonderful</i> baseball pitcher or one of those basketball jumpers, their mother assured them both time and again. Henry’s grades were bad and he needed to repeat a number of subjects—but that wasn’t because Henry was stupid; Eddie and Mrs. Dean both knew Henry was just as smart as lickety-split. But Henry had to spend the time he should have spent studying or doing homework taking care of Eddie (the fact that this usually took place in the Dean living room, with both boys sprawled on the sofa watching TV or wrestling around on the floor somehow seemed not to matter). The bad grades meant Henry hadn’t been able to be accepted into anything but NYU, and they couldn’t afford it because the bad grades precluded any scholarships, and then Henry got drafted and then it was Viet Nam, where Henry got most of his knee blown off, and the pain was bad, and the drug they gave him for it had a heavy morphine base, and when he was better they weaned him from the drug, only they didn’t do such a good job because when Henry got back to New York there was still a monkey on his back, a hungry monkey waiting to be fed, and after a month or two he had gone out to see a man, and it had been about four months later, less than a month after their mother died, when Eddie first saw his brother snorting some white powder off a mirror. Eddie assumed it was coke. Turned out it was heroin. And if you traced it all the way back, whose fault was it?</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland said nothing, but heard the voice of Cort in his mind: <i class="calibre">Fault always lies in the same place, my fine babies: with him weak enough to lay blame.</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">When he discovered the truth, Eddie had been shocked, then angry. Henry had responded not by promising to quit snorting but by telling Eddie he didn’t blame him for being mad, he knew Nam had <a id="page-171"></a>turned him into a worthless shitbag, he was weak, he would leave, that was the best thing, Eddie was right, the last thing he needed was a filthy junkie around, messing up the place. He just hoped Eddie wouldn’t blame him too much. He had gotten weak, he admitted it; something in Nam had made him weak, had rotted him out the same way the moisture rotted the laces of your sneakers and the elastic of your underwear. There was also something in Nam that apparently rotted out your heart, Henry told him tearily. He just hoped that Eddie would remember all the years he had tried to be strong.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">For Eddie.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">For Mom.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">So Henry tried to leave. And Eddie, of course, couldn’t let him. Eddie was consumed with guilt. Eddie had seen the scarred horror that had once been an unmarked leg, a knee that was now more Teflon than bone. They had a screaming match in the hall, Henry standing there in an old pair of khakis with his packed duffle bag in one hand and purple rings under his eyes, Eddie wearing nothing but a pair of yellowing jockey shorts, Henry saying you don’t need me around, Eddie, I’m poison to you and I know it, and Eddie yelling back You ain’t going nowhere, get your ass back inside, and that’s how it went until Mrs. McGursky came out of <i class="calibre">her</i> place and yelled <i class="calibre">Go or stay, it’s nothing to me, but you better decide one way or the other pretty quick or I’m calling the police.</i> Mrs. McGursky seemed about to add a few more admonishments, but just then she saw that Eddie was wearing nothing but a pair of skivvies. She added: <i class="calibre">And you’re not decent, Eddie Dean!</i> before popping back inside. It was like watching a Jack-in-the-box in reverse. Eddie looked at Henry. Henry looked at Eddie. <i class="calibre">Look like Angel-Baby done put on a few pounds,</i> Henry said in a low voice, and then they were howling with laughter, holding onto each other and pounding each other and Henry came back inside and about two weeks later Eddie was snorting the stuff too and he couldn’t understand why the hell he had made such a big deal out of it, after all, it was only <i class="calibre">snorting,</i> shit, it got you off, and as Henry (who Eddie would eventually come to think of as the great sage and eminent <a id="page-172"></a>junkie) said, in a world that was clearly going to hell head-first, what was so low about getting high?</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Time passed. Eddie didn’t say how much. The gunslinger didn’t ask. He guessed that Eddie knew there were a thousand excuses for getting high but no reasons, and that he had kept his habit pretty well under control. And that Henry had also managed to keep <i class="calibre">his</i> under control. Not as well as Eddie, but enough to keep from coming completely unravelled. Because whether or not Eddie understood the truth (down deep Roland believed Eddie did), Henry must have: their positions had reversed themselves. Now Eddie held Henry’s hand crossing streets.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The day came when Eddie caught Henry not snorting but skin-popping. There had been another hysterical argument, an almost exact repeat of the first one, except it had been in Henry’s bedroom. It ended in almost exactly the same way, with Henry weeping and offering that implacable, inarguable defense that was utter surrender, utter admission: Eddie was right, he wasn’t fit to live, not fit to eat garbage from the gutter. He would go. Eddie would never have to see him again. He just hoped he would remember all the . . .</p>

    <p class="para-indent">It faded into a drone that wasn’t much different from the rocky sound of the breaking waves as they trudged up the beach. Roland knew the story and said nothing. It was <i class="calibre">Eddie</i> who didn’t know the story, an Eddie who was really clear-headed for the first time in maybe ten years or more. Eddie wasn’t telling the story to Roland; Eddie was finally telling the story to himself.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">That was all right. So far as the gunslinger could see, time was something they had a lot of. Talk was one way to fill it.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie said he was haunted by Henry’s knee, the twisted scar tissue up and down his leg (of course that was all healed now, Henry barely even limped . . . except when he and Eddie were quarrelling; then the limp always seemed to get worse); he was haunted by all the things Henry had given up for him, and haunted by something much more pragmatic: Henry wouldn’t last out on the streets. He would be like a rabbit let loose in a jungle filled with tigers. On his own, Henry would wind up in jail or Bellevue before a week was out.</p><a id="page-173"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">So he begged, and Henry finally did him the favor of consenting to stick around, and six months after that Eddie also had a golden arm. From that moment things had begun to move in the steady and inevitable downward spiral which had ended with Eddie’s trip to the Bahamas and Roland’s sudden intervention in his life.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Another man, less pragmatic and more introspective than Roland, might have asked (to himself, if not right out loud), <i class="calibre">Why this one? Why this man to start? Why a man who seems to promise weakness or strangeness or even outright doom?</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">Not only did the gunslinger never ask the question; it never even formulated itself in his mind. Cuthbert would have asked; Cuthbert had questioned everything, had been poisoned with questions, had died with one in his mouth. Now they were gone, all gone. Cort’s last gunslingers, the thirteen survivors of a beginning class that had numbered fifty-six, were all dead. All dead but Roland. He was the last gunslinger, going steadily on in a world that had grown stale and sterile and empty.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">Thirteen,</i> he remembered Cort saying on the day before the Presentation Ceremonies. <i class="calibre">This is an evil number.</i> And on the following day, for the first time in thirty years, Cort had not been present at the Ceremonies. His final crop of pupils had gone to his cottage to first kneel at his feet, presenting defenseless necks, then to rise and receive his congratulatory kiss and to allow him to load their guns for the first time. Nine weeks later, Cort was dead. Of poison, some said. Two years after his death, the final bloody civil war had begun. The red slaughter had reached the last bastion of civilization, light, and sanity, and had taken away what all of them had assumed was so strong with the casual ease of a wave taking a child’s castle of sand.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">So he was the last, and perhaps he had survived because the dark romance in his nature was overset by his practicality and simplicity. He understood that only three things mattered: mortality, <i class="calibre">ka,</i> and the Tower.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Those were enough things to think about.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie finished his tale around four o’clock on the third day of their northward journey up the featureless beach. The beach itself <a id="page-174"></a>never seemed to change. If a sign of progress was wanted, it could only be obtained by looking left, to the east. There the jagged peaks of the mountains had begun to soften and slump a bit. It was possible that if they went north far enough, the mountains would become rolling hills.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">With his story told, Eddie lapsed into silence and they walked without speaking for a half an hour or longer. Eddie kept stealing little glances at him. Roland knew Eddie wasn’t aware that he was picking these glances up; he was still too much in himself. Roland also knew what Eddie was waiting for: a response. Some kind of response. <i class="calibre">Any</i> kind. Twice Eddie opened his mouth only to close it again. Finally he asked what the gunslinger had known he would ask.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“So? What do you think?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I think you’re here.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie stopped, fisted hands planted on his hips. “That’s <i class="calibre">all?</i> That’s <i class="calibre">it?</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“That’s all I know,” the gunslinger replied. His missing fingers and toe throbbed and itched. He wished for some of the <i class="calibre">astin</i> from Eddie’s world.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You don’t have any opinion on what the hell it all <i class="calibre">means?</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger might have held up his subtracted right hand and said, <i class="calibre">Think about what</i> this <i class="calibre">means, you silly idiot,</i> but it no more crossed his mind to say this than it had to ask why it was Eddie, out of all the people in all the universes that might exist. “It’s <i class="calibre">ka,</i>” he said, facing Eddie patiently.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“What’s <i class="calibre">ka?</i>” Eddie’s voice was truculent. “I never heard of it. Except if you say it twice you come out with the baby word for shit.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I don’t know about that,” the gunslinger said. “Here it means duty, or destiny, or, in the vulgate, a place you must go.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie managed to look dismayed, disgusted, and amused all at the same time. “Then say it twice, Roland, because words like that sound like shit to this kid.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger shrugged. “I don’t discuss philosophy. I don’t study history. All I know is what’s past is past, and what’s ahead is ahead. The second is <i class="calibre">ka,</i> and takes care of itself.”</p><a id="page-175"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">“Yeah?” Eddie looked northward. “Well all I see ahead is about nine billion miles of this same fucking beach. If <i class="calibre">that’s</i> what’s ahead, <i class="calibre">ka</i> and kaka are the same thing. We might have enough good shells to pop five or six more of those lobster dudes, but then we’re going to be down to chucking rocks at them. So where are we <i class="calibre">going?</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland <i class="calibre">did</i> wonder briefly if this was a question Eddie had ever thought to ask his brother, but to ask such a question would only be an invitation to a lot of meaningless argument. So he only cocked a thumb northward and said, “There. To begin with.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie looked and saw nothing but the same reach of shell- and rock-studded gray shingle. He looked back at Roland, about to scoff, saw the serene certainty on his face, and looked again. He squinted. He shielded the right side of his face from the westering sun with his right hand. He wanted desperately to see something, <i class="calibre">anything,</i> shit, even a mirage would do, but there was nothing.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Crap on me all you want to,” Eddie said slowly, “but I say it’s a goddam mean trick. I put my life on the line for you at Balazar’s.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I know you did.” The gunslinger smiled—a rarity that lit his face like a momentary flash of sunlight on a dismal louring day. “That’s why I’ve done nothing but square-deal you, Eddie. It’s there. I saw it an hour ago. At first I thought it was only a mirage or wishful thinking, but it’s there, all right.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie looked again, looked until water ran from the corners of his eyes. At last he said, “I don’t see anything up ahead but more beach. And I got twenty-twenty vision.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I don’t know what that means.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“It means if there was something there to see, I’d <i class="calibre">see</i> it!” But Eddie wondered. Wondered how much further than his own the gunslinger’s blue bullshooter’s eyes could see. Maybe a little.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Maybe a <i class="calibre">lot.</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You’ll see it,” the gunslinger said.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“See <i class="calibre">what?</i>”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“We won’t get there today, but if you see as well as you say, you’ll see it before the sun hits the water. Unless you just want to stand here chin-jawing, that is.”</p><a id="page-176"></a>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Ka,”</i> Eddie said in a musing voice.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Roland nodded. <i class="calibre">“Ka.”</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Kaka,”</i> Eddie said, and laughed. “Come on, Roland. Let’s take a hike. And if I <i class="calibre">don’t</i> see anything by the time the sun hits the water, you owe me a chicken dinner. Or a Big Mac. Or <i class="calibre">anything</i> that isn’t lobster.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Come on.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">They started walking again, and it was at least a full hour before the sun’s lower arc touched the horizon when Eddie Dean began to see the shape in the distance—vague, shimmering, indefinable, but definitely <i class="calibre">something.</i> Something <i class="calibre">new.</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Okay,” he said. “I see it. You must have eyes like Superman.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Who?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Never mind. You’ve got a really incredible case of culture lag, you know it?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“What?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie laughed. “Never mind. What is it?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You’ll see.” The gunslinger started walking again before Eddie could ask anything else.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Twenty minutes later Eddie thought he <i class="calibre">did</i> see. Fifteen minutes after that he was sure. The object on the beach was still two, maybe three miles away, but he knew what it was. A door, of course. Another door.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Neither of them slept well that night, and they were up and walking an hour before the sun cleared the eroding shapes of the mountains. They reached the door just as the morning sun’s first rays, so sublime and so still, broke over them. Those rays lighted their stubbly cheeks like lamps. They made the gunslinger forty again, and Eddie no older than Roland had been when he went out to fight Cort with his hawk David as his weapon.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">This door was exactly like the first, except for what was writ upon it:</p>

    <h4 class="sub1">THE LADY OF SHADOWS</h4><a id="page-177"></a>

    <p class="para-flush">“So,” Eddie said softly, looking at the door which simply stood here with its hinges grounded in some unknown jamb between one world and another, one universe and another. It stood with its graven message, real as rock and strange as starlight.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“So,” the gunslinger agreed.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Ka.”</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Ka.”</i></p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Here is where you draw the second of your three?”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“It seems so.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger knew what was in Eddie’s mind before Eddie knew it himself. He saw Eddie make his move before Eddie knew he was moving. He could have turned and broken Eddie’s arm in two places before Eddie knew it was happening, but he made no move. He let Eddie snake the revolver from his right holster. It was the first time in his life he had allowed one of his weapons to be taken from him without an offer of that weapon having first been made. Yet he made no move to stop it. He turned and looked at Eddie equably, even mildly.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie’s face was livid, strained. His eyes showed starey whites all the way around the irises. He held the heavy revolver in both hands and still the muzzle rambled from side to side, centering, moving off, centering again and then moving off again.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“Open it,” he said.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You’re being foolish,” the gunslinger said in the same mild voice. “Neither of us has any idea where that door goes. It needn’t open on your <i class="calibre">universe,</i> let alone upon your world. For all either of us know, the Lady of Shadows might have eight eyes and nine arms, like Suvia. Even if it does open on your world, it might be on a time long before you were born or long after you would have died.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">Eddie smiled tightly. “Tell you what, Monty: I’m more than willing to trade the rubber chicken and the shitty seaside vacation for what’s behind Door #2.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I don’t understand y—”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I know you don’t. It doesn’t matter. Just open the fucker.”</p><a id="page-178"></a>

    <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger shook his head.</p>

    <p class="para-indent">They stood in the dawn, the door casting its slanted shadow toward the ebbing sea.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Open it!”</i> Eddie cried. “I’m going with you! Don’t you get it? I’m going <i class="calibre">with</i> you! That doesn’t mean I won’t come back. Maybe I will. I mean, <i class="calibre">probably</i> I will. I guess I owe you that much. You been square-john with me down the line, don’t think I’m not aware of the fact. But while you get whoever this Shadow-Babe is, I’m gonna find the nearest Chicken Delight and pick me up some take-out. I think the Thirty-Piece Family Pak should do for starters.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You stay here.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“You think I don’t mean it?” Eddie was shrill now, close to the edge. The gunslinger could almost see him looking down into the drifty depths of his own damnation. Eddie thumbed back the revolver’s ancient hammer. The wind had fallen with the break of the day and the ebb of the tide, and the click of the hammer as Eddie brought it to full cock was very clear. “You just try me.”</p>

    <p class="para-indent">“I think I will,” the gunslinger said.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“I’ll shoot you!”</i> Eddie screamed.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">“Ka,”</i> the gunslinger replied stolidly, and turned to the door. He was reaching for the knob, but his heart was waiting: waiting to see if he would live or die.</p>

    <p class="para-indent"><i class="calibre">Ka.</i></p><a id="page-179"></a>
