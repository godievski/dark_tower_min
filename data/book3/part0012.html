  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE WAS ALMOST ASLEEP when a voice spoke clearly in his ear: <i class="calibre3">Tell him to grab the key. The key makes the voices go.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He sat bolt upright, looking around wildly. Susannah was sound asleep beside him; that voice had not been hers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Nor anyone else’s, it seemed. They had been moving through the woods and along the path of the Beam for eight days now, and this evening they had camped in the deep cleft of a pocket valley. Close by on the left, a large stream roared brashly past, headed in the same direction as they were: southeast. To the right, firs rose up a steep slope of land. There were no intruders here; only Susannah asleep and Roland awake. He sat huddled beneath his blanket at the edge of the stream’s cut, staring out into the darkness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Tell him to grab the key. The key makes the voices go.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie hesitated for only a moment. Roland’s sanity was in the balance now, the balance was tipping the wrong way, and the worst part of it was this: no one knew it better than the man himself. At this point, Eddie was prepared to clutch at any straw.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had been using a folded square of deerskin as a pillow. He reached beneath it and removed a bundle wrapped in a piece of hide. He walked over to Roland, and was disturbed to see that the gunslinger did not notice him until he was less than four steps from his unprotected back. There had been a time—and it was not so long ago—when Roland would have known Eddie was awake even before Eddie sat up. He would have heard the change in his breathing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">He was more alert than this back on the beach, when he was half-dead from the lobster-thing’s bite,</i> Eddie thought grimly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland at last turned his head and glanced at him. His eyes were bright with pain and weariness, but Eddie recognized these things as no more than a surface glitter. Beneath it, he sensed a growing confusion that would almost surely become madness if it continued to develop unchecked. Pity tugged at Eddie’s heart.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Can’t sleep?” Roland asked. His voice was slow, almost drugged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I almost was, and then I woke up,” Eddie said. “Listen—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think I’m getting ready to die.” Roland looked at Eddie. The bright shine left his eyes, and now looking into them was like staring into a pair of deep, dark wells that seemed to have no bottom. Eddie shuddered, more because of that empty stare than because of what Roland had said. “And do you know what I hope lies in the clearing where the path ends, Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Silence,” Roland said. He exhaled a dusty sigh. “Just silence. That will be enough. An end to . . . this.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He planted his fists against his temples, and Eddie thought: <i class="calibre3">I’ve seen someone else do that, and not long ago. But who? Where?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was ridiculous of course; he had seen no one but Roland and Susannah for almost two months now. But it felt true, all the same.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland, I’ve been making something,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. A ghost of a smile touched his lips. “I know. What is it? Are you finally ready to tell?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think it might be part of this <i class="calibre3">ka-tet</i> thing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The vacant look left Roland’s eyes. He gazed at Eddie thoughtfully but said nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look.” Eddie began to unfold the piece of hide.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That won’t do any good!</i> Henry’s voice suddenly brayed. It was so loud that Eddie actually flinched a little. <i class="calibre3">It’s just a stupid piece of wood-carving! He’ll take one look and laugh at it! He’ll laugh at you! “Oh, lookit this!” he’ll say. “Did the sissy carve something?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shut up,” Eddie muttered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger raised his eyebrows.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded, unsurprised. “Your brother comes to you often, doesn’t he, Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment Eddie only stared at him, his carving still hidden in the hide square. Then he smiled. It was not a very pleasant smile. “Not as often as he used to, Roland. Thank Christ for small favors.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said. “Too many voices weigh heavy on a man’s heart . . . What is it, Eddie? Show me, please.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie held up the chunk of ash. The key, almost complete, emerged from it like the head of a woman from the prow of a sailing ship . . . or the hilt of a sword from a chunk of stone. Eddie didn’t know how close he had come to duplicating the key-shape he had seen in the fire (and never would, he supposed, unless he found the right lock in which to try it), but he thought it was close. Of one thing he was quite sure: it was the best carving he had ever done. By far.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “By the gods, Eddie, it’s beautiful!” Roland said. The apathy was gone from his voice; he spoke in a tone of surprised reverence Eddie had never heard before. “Is it done? It’s not, is it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No—not quite.” He ran his thumb into the third notch, and then over the <i class="calibre3">s</i>-shape at the end of the last notch. “There’s a little more to do on this notch, and the curve at the end isn’t right yet. I don’t know how I know that, but I do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This is your secret.” It wasn’t a question.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Now if only I knew what it meant.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland looked around. Eddie followed his gaze and saw Susannah. He found some relief in the fact that Roland had heard her first.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What you boys doin up so late? Chewin the fat?” She saw the wooden key in Eddie’s hand and nodded. “I wondered when you were going to get around to showing that off. It’s good, you know. I don’t know what it’s for, but it’s damned good.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You don’t have any idea what door it might open?” Roland asked Eddie. “That was not part of your <i class="calibre3">khef?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No—but it might be good for something even though it isn’t done.” He held the key out to Roland. “I want you to keep it for me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland didn’t move to take it. He regarded Eddie closely. “Why?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because . . . well . . . because I think someone told me you should.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Your boy</i>, Eddie thought suddenly, and as soon as the thought came he knew it was true. <i class="calibre3">It was your goddamned boy.</i> But he didn’t want to say so. He didn’t want to mention the boy’s name at all. It might just set Roland off again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. But I think you ought to give it a try.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland reached slowly for the key. As his fingers touched it, a bright glimmer seemed to flash down its barrel, but it was gone so quickly that Eddie could not be sure he had seen it. It might have been only starlight.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland’s hand closed over the key growing out of the branch. For a moment his face showed nothing. Then his brow furrowed and his head cocked in a listening gesture.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What is it?” Susannah asked. “Do you hear—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Shhhh!”</i> The puzzlement on Roland’s face was slowly being replaced with wonder. He looked from Eddie to Susannah and then back to Eddie. His eyes were filling with some great emotion, as a pitcher fills with water when it is dipped in a spring.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland?” Eddie asked uneasily. “Are you all right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland whispered something. Eddie couldn’t hear what it was.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah looked scared. She glanced frantically at Eddie, as if to ask, <i class="calibre3">What did you do to him?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie took one of her hands in both of his own. “I think it’s all right.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland’s hand was clamped so tightly on the chunk of wood that Eddie was momentarily afraid he might snap it in two, but the wood was strong and Eddie had carved thick. The gunslinger’s throat bulged; his Adam’s apple rose and fell as he struggled with speech. And suddenly he yelled at the sky in a fair, strong voice:
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“GONE! THE VOICES ARE GONE!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked back at them, and Eddie saw something he had never expected to see in his life—not even if that life stretched over a thousand years.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland of Gilead was weeping.

  <div class="tx">
    IN ANOTHER WORLD, BUT beneath the shadow of the same <i class="calibre3">ka-tet,</i> Jake Chambers was having the most vivid dream of his life.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was walking through the tangled remains of an ancient forest—a dead zone of fallen trees and scruffy, aggravating bushes that bit his ankles and tried to steal his sneakers. He came to a thin belt of younger trees (alders, he thought, or perhaps beeches—he was a city boy, and the only thing he knew for sure about trees was that some had leaves and some had needles) and discovered a path through them. He made his way along this, moving a little faster. There was a clearing of some sort up ahead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stopped once before reaching it, when he spied some sort of stone marker to his right. He left the path to look at it. There were letters carved into it, but they were so eroded he couldn’t make them out. At last he closed his eyes (he had never done this in a dream before) and let his fingers trace each letter, like a blind boy reading Braille. Each formed in the darkness behind his lids until they made a sentence which stood forth in an outline of blue light:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="ctag">
        TRAVELLER, BEYOND LIES MID-WORLD.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Sleeping in his bed, Jake drew his knees up against his chest. The hand holding the key was under his pillow, and now his fingers tightened their grip on it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Mid-World,</i> he thought, <i class="calibre3">of course. St. Louis and Topeka and Oz and the World’s Fair and Charlie the Choo-Choo.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He opened his dreaming eyes and pressed on. The clearing behind the trees was paved with old cracked asphalt. A faded yellow circle had been painted in the middle. Jake realized it was a playground basketball court even before he saw the boy at the far end, standing at the foul line and shooting baskets with a dusty old Wilson ball. They popped in one after another, falling neatly through the netless hole. The basket jutted out from something that looked like a subway kiosk which had been shut up for the night. Its closed door was painted in alternating diagonal stripes of yellow and black. From behind it—or perhaps from below it—Jake could hear the steady rumble of powerful machinery. The sound was somehow disturbing. Scary.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Don’t step on the robots,</i> the boy shooting the baskets said without turning around. <i class="calibre3">I guess they’re all dead, but I wouldn’t take any chances, if I were you.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked around and saw a number of shattered mechanical devices lying around. One looked like a rat or mouse, another like a bat. A mechanical snake lay in two rusty pieces almost at his feet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">ARE you me?</i> Jake asked, taking a step closer to the boy at the basket, but even before he turned around, Jake knew that wasn’t the case. The boy was bigger than Jake, and at least thirteen. His hair was darker, and when he looked at Jake, he saw that the stranger’s eyes were hazel. His own were blue.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What do you think?</i> the strange boy asked, and bounce-passed the ball to Jake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No, of course not,</i> Jake said. He spoke apologetically. <i class="calibre3">It’s just that I’ve been cut in two for the last three weeks or so.</i> He dipped and shot from mid-court. The ball arched high and dropped silently through the hoop. He was delighted . . . but he discovered he was also afraid of what this strange boy might have to tell him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I know,</i> the boy said. <i class="calibre3">It’s been a bitch for you, hasn’t it?</i> He was wearing faded madras shorts and a yellow T-shirt that said NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN MID-WORLD. He had tied a green bandanna around his forehead to keep his hair out of his eyes. <i class="calibre3">And things are going to get worse before they get better</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What is this place?</i> Jake asked. <i class="calibre3">And who are you?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s the Portal of the Bear . . . but it’s also Brooklyn.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That didn’t seem to make sense, and yet somehow it did. Jake told himself that things always seemed that way in dreams, but this didn’t really <i class="calibre3">feel</i> like a dream.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">As for me, I don’t matter much</i>, the boy said. He hooked the basketball over his shoulder. It rose, then dropped smoothly through the hoop. <i class="calibre3">I’m supposed to guide you, that’s all. I’ll take you where you need to go, and I’ll show you what you need to see, but you have to be careful because I won’t know you. And strangers make Henry nervous. He can get mean when he’s nervous, and he’s bigger than you.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Who’s Henry?</i> Jake asked<i class="calibre3">.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Never mind. Just don’t let him notice you. All you have to do is hang out . . . and follow us. Then, when we leave . . .</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The boy looked at Jake. There was both pity and fear in his eyes. Jake suddenly realized that the boy was starting to <i class="calibre3">fade</i>—he could see the yellow and black slashes on the box right through the boy’s yellow T-shirt.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">How will I find you?</i> Jake was suddenly terrified that the boy would melt away completely before he could say everything Jake needed to hear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No problem,</i> the boy said. His voice had taken on a queer, chiming echo. <i class="calibre3">Just take the subway to Co-Op City. You’ll find me.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No, I won’t! Jake cried. Co-Op City’s huge! There must be a hundred thousand people living there!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now the boy was just a milky outline. Only his hazel eyes were still completely there, like the Cheshire cat’s grin in <i class="calibre3">Alice.</i> They regarded Jake with compassion and anxiety. <i class="calibre3">No problem-o,</i> he said. <i class="calibre3">You found the key and the rose, didn’t you? You’ll find me the same way. This afternoon, Jake. Around three o’clock should be good. You’ll have to be careful, and you’ll have to be quick.</i> He paused, a ghostly boy with an old basketball lying near one transparent foot. <i class="calibre3">I have to go now . . . but it was good to meet you. You seem like a nice kid, and I’m not surprised he loves you. Remember, there’s danger, though. Be careful . . . and be quick</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Wait!</i> Jake yelled, and ran across the basketball court toward the disappearing boy. One of his feet struck a shattered robot that looked like a child’s toy tractor. He stumbled and fell to his knees, shredding his pants. He ignored the thin burn of pain. <i class="calibre3">Wait! You have to tell me what all this is about! You have to tell me why these things are happening to me!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Because of the Beam,</i> the boy who was now only a pair of floating eyes replied, <i class="calibre3">and because of the Tower. In the end, all things, even the Beams, serve the Dark Tower. Did you think you would be any different?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake flailed and stumbled to his feet. <i class="calibre3">Will I find him? Will I find the gunslinger?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I don’t know,</i> the boy answered. His voice now seemed to come from a million miles away. <i class="calibre3">I only know you must try. About that you have no choice.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The boy was gone. The basketball court in the woods was empty. The only sound was that faint rumble of machinery, and Jake didn’t like it. There was something wrong with that sound, and he thought that what was wrong with the machinery was affecting the rose, or vice-versa. It was all hooked together somehow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He picked up the old, scuffed-up basketball and shot. It went neatly through the hoop . . . and disappeared.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">A river</i>, the strange boy’s voice sighed. It was like a puff of breeze. It came from nowhere and everywhere. <i class="calibre3">The answer is a river.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE WOKE IN THE first milky light of dawn, looking up at the ceiling of his room. He was thinking of the guy in The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind—Aaron Deepneau, who’d been hanging around on Bleecker Street back when Bob Dylan only knew how to blow open G on his Hohner. Aaron Deepneau had given Jake a riddle.
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx">
      <i class="calibre3">What can run but never walks,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
      <i class="calibre3">Has a mouth but never talks,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
      <i class="calibre3">Has a bed but never sleeps,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
      <i class="calibre3">Has a head but never weeps?</i>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now he knew the answer. A river ran; a river had a mouth; a river had a bed; a river had a head. The boy had told him the answer. The boy in the dream.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And suddenly he thought of something else Deepneau had said: <i class="calibre3">That’s only half the answer. Samson’s riddle is a double, my friend.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake glanced at his bedside clock and saw it was twenty past six. It was time to get moving if he wanted to be out of here before his parents woke up. There would be no school for him today; Jake thought that maybe, as far as he was concerned, school had been cancelled forever.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He threw back the bedclothes, swung his feet out onto the floor, and saw that there were scrapes on both knees. Fresh scrapes. He had bruised his left side yesterday when he slipped on the bricks and fell, and he had banged his head when he fainted near the rose, but nothing had happened to his knees.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That happened in the dream,” Jake whispered, and found he wasn’t surprised at all. He began to dress swiftly.

    IN THE BACK OF his closet, under a jumble of old laceless sneakers and a heap of <i class="calibre3">Spiderman</i> comic books, he found the packsack he had worn to grammar school. No one would be caught dead with a packsack at Piper—how too, too common, my deah—and as Jake grabbed it, he felt a wave of powerful nostalgia for those old days when life had seemed so simple.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stuffed a clean shirt, a clean pair of jeans, some underwear and socks into it, then added <i class="calibre3">Riddle-De-Dum!</i> and <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo.</i> He had put the key on his desk before foraging in the closet for his old pack, and the voices came back at once, but they were distant and muted. Besides, he felt sure he could make them go away completely by holding the key again, and that eased his mind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Okay,</i> he thought, looking into the pack. Even with the books added, there was plenty of room left. <i class="calibre3">What else?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment he thought there was nothing else . . . and then he knew.

  <div class="tx">
    HIS FATHER’S STUDY SMELLED of cigarettes and ambition.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was dominated by a huge teakwood desk. Across the room, set into a wall otherwise lined with books, were three Mitsubishi television monitors. Each was tuned to one of the rival networks, and at night, when his father was in here, each played out its progression of prime-time images with the sound off.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The curtains were drawn, and Jake had to turn on the desk lamp in order to see. He felt nervous just being in here, even wearing sneakers. If his father should wake up and come in (and it was possible; no matter how late he went to bed or how much he drank, Elmer Chambers was a light sleeper and an early riser), he would be angry. At the very least it would make a clean getaway much tougher. The sooner he was out of here, the better Jake would feel.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The desk was locked, but his father had never made any secret of where he kept the key. Jake slid his fingers under the blotter and hooked it out. He opened the third drawer, reached past the hanging files, and touched cold metal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A board creaked in the hall and he froze. Several seconds passed. When the creak didn’t come again, Jake pulled out the weapon his father kept for “home defense”—a .44 Ruger automatic. His father had shown this weapon to Jake with great pride on the day he had bought it—two years ago, that had been. He had been totally deaf to his wife’s nervous demands that he put it away before someone got hurt.

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake found the button on the side that released the clip. It fell out into his hand with a metallic <i class="calibre3">snak!</i> sound that seemed very loud in the quiet apartment. He glanced nervously toward the door again, then turned his attention to the clip. It was fully loaded. He started to slide it back into the gun, and then took it out again. Keeping a loaded gun in a locked desk drawer was one thing; carrying one around New York City was quite another.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stuffed the automatic down to the bottom of his pack, then felt behind the hanging files again. This time he brought out a box of shells, about half-full. He remembered his father had done some target shooting at the police range on First Avenue before losing interest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The board creaked again. Jake wanted to get out of here.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He removed one of the shirts he’d packed, laid it on his father’s desk, and rolled up the clip and the box of .44 slugs in it. Then he replaced it in the pack and used the buckles to snug down the flap. He was about to leave when his eye fixed on the little pile of stationery sitting beside his father’s In/Out tray. The reflectorized Ray-Ban sunglasses his father liked to wear were folded on top of the stationery. He took a sheet of paper, and, after a moment’s thought, the sunglasses as well. He slipped the shades into his breast pocket. Then he removed the slim gold pen from its stand, and wrote <i class="calibre3">Dear Dad and Mom</i> beneath the letterhead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stopped, frowning at the salutation. What went below it? What, exactly, did he have to say? That he loved them? It was true, but it wasn’t enough—there were all sorts of other unpleasant truths stuck through that central one, like steel needles jabbed into a ball of yarn. That he would miss them? He didn’t know if that was true or not, which was sort of horrible. That he hoped <i class="calibre3">they</i> would miss <i class="calibre3">him?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He suddenly realized what the problem was. If he were planning to be gone just today, he would be able to write something. But he felt a near-certainty that it <i class="calibre3">wasn’t</i> just today, or this week, or this month, or this summer. He had an idea that when he walked out of the apartment this time, it would be for good.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He almost crumpled the sheet of paper, then changed his mind. He wrote: <i class="calibre3">Please take care of yourselves. Love, J.</i> That was pretty limp, but at least it was something.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Fine. Now will you stop pressing your luck and get out of here?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He did.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The apartment was almost dead still. He tiptoed across the living room, hearing only the sounds of his parents’ breathing: his mother’s soft little snores, his father’s more nasal respiration, where every indrawn breath ended in a slim high whistle. The refrigerator kicked on as he reached the entryway and he froze for a moment, his heart thumping hard in his chest. Then he was at the door. He unlocked it as quietly as he could, then stepped out and pulled it gently shut behind him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A stone seemed to roll off his heart as the latch snicked, and a strong sense of anticipation seized him. He didn’t know what lay ahead, and he had reason to believe it would be dangerous, but he was eleven years old—too young to deny the exotic delight which suddenly filled him. There was a highway ahead—a hidden highway leading deep into some unknown land. There were secrets which might disclose themselves to him if he was clever . . . and if he was lucky. He had left his home in the long light of dawn, and what lay ahead was some great adventure.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">If I stand, if I can be true, I’ll see the rose, he thought as he pushed the button for the elevator. I know it . . . and I’ll see him, too.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This thought filled him with an eagerness so great it was almost ecstasy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Three minutes later he stepped out from beneath the awning which shaded the entrance to the building where he had lived all his life. He paused for a moment, then turned left. This decision did not feel random, and it wasn’t. He was moving southeast, along the path of the Beam, resuming his own interrupted quest for the Dark Tower.

  <div class="tx">
    Two DAYS AFTER EDDIE had given Roland his unfinished key, the three travellers—hot, sweaty, tired, and out of sorts—pushed through a particularly tenacious tangle of bushes and second-growth trees and discovered what first appeared to be two faint paths, running in tandem beneath the interlacing branches of the old trees crowding close on either side. After a few moments of study, Eddie decided they weren’t just paths but the remains of a long-abandoned road. Bushes and stunted trees grew like untidy quills along what had been its crown. The grassy indentations were wheelruts, and either of them was wide enough to accommodate Susannah’s wheelchair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hallelujah!” he cried. “Let’s drink to it!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded and unslung the waterskin he wore around his waist. He first handed it up to Susannah, who was riding in her sling on his back. Eddie’s key, now looped around Roland’s neck on a piece of rawhide, shifted beneath his shirt with each movement. She took a swallow and passed the skin to Eddie. He drank and then began to unfold her chair. Eddie had come to hate this bulky, balky contraption; it was like an iron anchor, always holding them back. Except for a broken spoke or two, it was still in fine condition. Eddie had days when he thought the goddam thing would outlast all of them. Now, however, it might be useful . . . for a while, at least.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie helped Susannah out of the harness and placed her in the chair. She put her hands against the small of her back, stretched, and grimaced with pleasure. Both Eddie and Roland heard the small crackle her spine made as it stretched.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Up ahead, a large creature that looked like a badger crossed with a raccoon ambled out of the woods. It looked at them with its large, gold-rimmed eyes, twitched its sharp, whiskery snout as if to say <i class="calibre3">Huh!</i> Big <i class="calibre3">deal!,</i> then strolled the rest of the way across the road and disappeared again. Before it did, Eddie noted its tail—long and closely coiled, it looked like a fur-covered bedspring.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What was that, Roland?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A billy-bumbler.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No good to eat?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “Tough. Sour. I’d rather eat dog.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Have you?” Susannah asked. “Eaten dog, I mean?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded, but did not elaborate. Eddie found himself thinking of a line from an old Paul Newman movie: <i class="calibre3">That’s right, lady—eaten em and lived like one.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Birds sang cheerily in the trees. A light breeze blew along the road. Eddie and Susannah turned their faces up to it gratefully, then looked at each other and smiled. Eddie was struck again by his gratitude for her—it was scary to have someone to love, but it was also very fine.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who made this road?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “People who have been gone a long time,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The same ones who made the cups and dishes we found?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No—not them. This used to be a coach-road, I imagine, and if it’s still here, after all these years of neglect, it must have been a great one indeed . . . perhaps <i class="calibre3">the</i> Great Road. If we dug down, I imagine we’d find the gravel undersurface, and maybe the drainage system, as well. As long as we’re here, let’s have a bite to eat.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Food!” Eddie cried. “Bring it on! Chicken Florentine! Polynesian shrimp! Veal lightly sautéed with mushrooms and—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah elbowed him. “Quit it, white boy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I can’t help it if I’ve got a vivid imagination,” Eddie said cheerfully.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland slipped his purse off his shoulder, hunkered down, and began to put together a small noon meal of dried meat wrapped in olive-colored leaves. Eddie and Susannah had discovered that these leaves tasted a little like spinach, only much stronger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie wheeled Susannah over to him and Roland handed her three of what Eddie called “gunslinger burritos.” She began to eat.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When Eddie turned back, Roland was holding out three of the wrapped pieces of meat to him—and something else, as well. It was the chunk of ash with the key growing out of it. Roland had taken it off the rawhide string, which now lay in an open loop around his neck.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hey, you need that, don’t you?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When I take it off, the voices return, but they’re very distant,” Roland said. “I can deal with them. Actually, I hear them even when I’m wearing it—like the voices of men who are speaking low over the next hill. I think that’s because the key is yet unfinished. You haven’t worked on it since you gave it to me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well . . . you were wearing it, and I didn’t want to . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland said nothing, but his faded blue eyes regarded Eddie with their patient teacher’s look.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right,” Eddie said, “I’m afraid of fucking it up. Satisfied?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “According to your brother, you fucked everything up . . . isn’t that right?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Susannah Dean, Girl Psychologist. You missed your calling, sweetheart.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah wasn’t offended by the sarcasm. She lifted the waterskin with her elbow, like a redneck tipping a jug, and drank deeply. “It’s true, though, isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie, who realized he hadn’t finished the slingshot, either—not yet, at least—shrugged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You have to finish it,” Roland said mildly. “I think the time is coming when you’ll have to put it to use.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie started to speak, then closed his mouth. It sounded easy when you said it right out like that, but neither of them really understood the bottom line. The bottom line was this: seventy per cent or eighty or even ninety-eight and a half just wouldn’t do. Not this time. And if he <i class="calibre3">did</i> screw up, he couldn’t just toss the thing over his shoulder and walk away. For one thing, he hadn’t seen another ash-tree since the day he had cut this particular piece of wood. But mostly the thing that was fucking him up was just this: it was all or nothing. If he messed up even a little, the key wouldn’t turn when they needed it to turn. And he was increasingly nervous about that little squiggle at the end. It looked simple, but if the curves weren’t exactly right . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It won’t work the way it is now, though; that much you do know</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He sighed, looking at the key. Yes, that much he did know. He would have to try to finish it. His fear of failure would make it even harder than it maybe had to be, but he would have to swallow the fear and try anyway. Maybe he could even bring it off. God knew he had brought off a lot in the weeks since Roland had entered his mind on a Delta jet bound into JFK Airport. That he was still alive and sane was an accomplishment in itself.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie handed the key back to Roland. “Wear it for now,” he said. “I’ll go back to work when we stop for the night.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Promise?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded, took the key, and began to re-knot the rawhide string. He worked slowly, but Eddie did not fail to notice how dextrously the remaining fingers on his right hand moved. The man was nothing if not adaptable.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Something <i class="calibre3">is</i> going to happen, isn’t it?” Susannah asked suddenly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie glanced up at her. “What makes you say so?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I sleep with you, Eddie, and I know you dream every night now. Sometimes you talk, too. They don’t seem like nightmares, exactly, but it’s pretty clear that <i class="calibre3">something</i> is going on inside your head.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Something is. I just don’t know what.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Dreams are powerful,” Roland remarked. “You don’t remember the ones you’re having at all?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie hesitated. “A little, but they’re confused. I’m a kid again, I know that much. It’s after school. Henry and I are shooting hoops at the old Markey Avenue playground, where the Juvenile Court Building is now. I want Henry to take me to see a place over in Dutch Hill. An old house. The kids used to call it The Mansion, and everyone said it was haunted. Maybe it even was. It was creepy, I know that much. <i class="calibre3">Real</i> creepy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shook his head, remembering.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I thought of The Mansion for the first time in years when we were in the bear’s clearing, and I put my head close to that weird box. I dunno—maybe that’s why I’m having the dream.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But you don’t think so,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. I think whatever’s happening is a lot more complicated than just remembering stuff.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Did you and your brother actually go to this place?” Roland asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah—I talked him into it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And did something happen?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. But it was scary. We stood there and looked at it for a little while, and Henry teased me—saying he was going to make me go in and pick up a souvenir, stuff like that—but I knew he didn’t really mean it. He was as scared of the place as I was.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And that’s it?” Susannah asked. “You just dream of going to this place? The Mansion?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There’s a little more than that. Someone comes . . . and then just kind of hangs out. I notice him in the dream, but just a little . . . like out of the corner of my eye, you know? Only I know we’re supposed to pretend we don’t know each other.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Was this someone really there that day?” Roland asked. He was watching Eddie intently. “Or is he only a player in this dream?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That was a long time ago. I couldn’t have been more than thirteen. How could I remember a thing like that for sure?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland said nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay,” Eddie said at last. “Yeah. I think he was there that day. A kid who was either carrying a gym-bag or wearing a backpack, I can’t remember which. And sunglasses that were too big for his face. The ones with the mirror lenses.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who was this person?” Roland asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was silent for a long time. He was holding the last of his <i class="calibre3">burritos à la Roland</i> in one hand, but he had lost his appetite. “I think it’s the kid you met at the way station,” he said at last. “I think your old friend Jake was hanging around, watching me and Henry on the afternoon we went over to Dutch Hill. I think he followed us. Because he hears the voices, just like you, Roland. And because he’s sharing my dreams, and I’m sharing his. I think that what I remember is what’s happening now, in Jake’s when. The kid is trying to come back here. And if the key isn’t done when he makes his move—or if it’s done wrong—he’s probably going to die.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland said, “Maybe he has a key of his own. Is that possible?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah, I think it is,” Eddie said, “but it isn’t enough.” He sighed and stuck the last burrito in his pocket for later. <i class="calibre3">“And I don’t think he knows that.”</i>

  <div class="tx">
    THEY MOVED ALONG, ROLAND and Eddie trading off on Susannah’s wheelchair. They picked the left-hand wheelrut. The chair bumped and pitched, and every now and then Eddie and Roland had to lift it over the cobbles which stuck out of the dirt here and there like old teeth. They were still making faster, easier time than they had in a week, however. The ground was rising, and when Eddie looked over his shoulder he could see the forest sloping away in what looked like a series of gentle steps. Far to the northwest, he could see a ribbon of water spilling over a fractured rock face. It was, he realized with wonder, the place they had dubbed “the shooting gallery.” Now it was almost lost behind them in the haze of this dreaming summer afternoon.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Whoa down, boy!” Susannah called sharply. Eddie faced forward again just in time to keep from pushing the wheelchair into Roland. The gunslinger had stopped and was peering into the tangled bushes at the left of the road.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You keep that up, I’m gonna revoke your driver’s license,” Susannah said waspily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie ignored her. He was following Roland’s gaze. “What is it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “One way to find out.” He turned, hoisted Susannah from her chair, and planted her on his hip. “Let’s all take a look.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Put me down, big boy—I can make my way. Easier’n you boys, if you really want to know.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As Roland gently lowered her to the grassy wheelrut, Eddie peered into the woods. The late light threw overlapping crosses of shadow, but he thought he saw what had caught Roland’s eye. It was a tall gray stone, almost completely hidden in a shag of vines and creepers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah slipped into the woods at the side of the road with eely sinuousness. Roland and Eddie followed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s a marker, isn’t it?” Susannah was propped on her hands studying the rectangular chunk of rock. It had once been straight, but now it leaned drunkenly to the right, like an old gravestone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Give me my knife, Eddie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie handed it over, then hunkered next to Susannah as the gunslinger cut away the vines. As they fell, he could see eroded letters carved into the stone, and he knew what they said before Roland had uncovered even half of the inscription:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="ctag">
        TRAVELLER, BEYOND LIES MID-WORLD.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h9"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_8"><b class="calibre4">9</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “WHAT DOES IT MEAN?” Susannah asked at last. Her voice was soft and awestruck; her eyes ceaselessly measured the gray stone plinth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It means that we’re nearing the end of this first stage.” Roland’s face was solemn and thoughtful as he handed his knife back to Eddie. “I think that we’ll keep to this old coach-road now—or rather, it will keep to us. It has taken up the path of the Beam. The woods will end soon. I expect a great change.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What is Mid-World?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “One of the large kingdoms which dominated the earth in the times before these. A kingdom of hope and knowledge and light—the sort of things we were trying to hold on to in my land before the darkness overtook us, as well. Some day if there’s time, I’ll tell you all the old stories . . . the ones I know, at least. They form a large tapestry, one which is beautiful but very sad.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “According to the old tales, a great city once stood at the edge of Mid-World—perhaps as great as your city of New York. It will be in ruins now, if it still exists at all. But there may be people . . . or monsters . . . or both. We’ll have to be on our guard.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He reached out his two-fingered right hand and touched the inscription. “Mid-World,” he said in a low, meditative voice. “Who would have thought . . .” He trailed off.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, there’s no help for it, is there?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger shook his head. “No help.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Ka,”</i> Susannah said suddenly, and they both looked at her.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_9"><b class="calibre4">10</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THERE WERE TWO HOURS of daylight left, and so they moved on. The road continued southeast, along the path of the Beam, and two other overgrown roads—smaller ones—joined the one they were following. Along one side of the second were the mossy, tumbled remains of what must have once been an immense rock wall. Nearby, a dozen fat billy-bumblers sat upon the ruins, watching the pilgrims with their odd gold-ringed eyes. To Eddie they looked like a jury with hanging on its mind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The road continued to grow wider and more clearly defined. Twice they passed the shells of long-deserted buildings. The second one, Roland said, might have been a windmill. Susannah said it looked haunted. “I wouldn’t be surprised,” the gunslinger replied. His matter-of-fact tone chilled both of them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When darkness forced a halt, the trees were thinning and the breeze which had chased around them all day became a light, warm wind. Ahead, the land continued to rise.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’ll come to the top of the ridge in a day or two,” Roland said. “Then we’ll see.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “See what?” Susannah asked, but Roland only shrugged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That night Eddie began to carve again, but with no real feeling of inspiration. The confidence and happiness he’d felt as the key first began to take shape had left him. His fingers felt clumsy and stupid. For the first time in months he thought longingly of how good it would be to have some heroin. Not a lot; he felt sure that a nickel bag and a rolled-up dollar bill would send him flying through this little carving project in no time flat.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What are you smiling about, Eddie?” Roland asked. He was sitting on the other side of the campfire; the low, wind-driven flames danced capriciously between them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Was I smiling?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I was just thinking about how stupid some people can be—you put them in a room with six doors, they’ll still walk into the walls. And then have the nerve to bitch about it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you’re afraid of what might be on the other side of the doors, maybe bouncing off the walls seems safer,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie nodded. “Maybe so.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He worked slowly, trying to see the shapes in the wood—that little <i class="calibre3">s</i>-shape in particular. He discovered it had become very dim.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Please, God, help me not to fuck this up,</i> he thought, but he was terribly afraid that he had already begun to do just that. At last he gave up, returned the key (which he had barely changed at all) to the gunslinger, and curled up beneath one of the hides. Five minutes later, the dream about the boy and the old Markey Avenue playground had begun to unspool again.

    JAKE STEPPED OUT OF his apartment building at about quarter of seven, which left him with over eight hours to kill. He considered taking the train out to Brooklyn right away, then decided it was a bad idea. A kid out of school was apt to attract more attention in the hinterlands than in the heart of a big city, and if he really had to <i class="calibre3">search</i> for the place and the boy he was supposed to meet there, he was cooked already.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No problem-o,</i> the boy in the yellow T-shirt and green bandanna had said. <i class="calibre3">You found the key and the rose, didn’t you? You’ll find me the same way.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Except Jake could no longer remember just how he <i class="calibre3">had</i> found the key and the rose. He could only remember the joy and the sense of surety which had filled his heart and head. He would just have to hope that would happen again. In the meantime, he’d keep moving. That was the best way to keep from being noticed in New York.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He walked most of the way to First Avenue, then headed back the way he had come, only sliding uptown little by little as he followed the pattern of the WALK lights (perhaps knowing, on some deep level, that even they served the Beam). Around ten o’clock he found himself in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue. He was hot, tired, and depressed. He wanted a soda, but he thought he ought to hold on to what little money he had for as long as he could. He’d taken every cent out of the box he kept by his bed, but it only amounted to eight dollars, give or take a few cents.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A group of school-kids were lining up for a tour. Public school, Jake was almost sure—they were dressed as casually as he was. No blazers from Paul Stuart, no ties, no jumpers, no simple little skirts that cost a hundred and twenty-five bucks at places like Miss So Pretty or Tweenity. This crowd was Kmart all the way. On impulse, Jake stood at the end of the line and followed them into the museum.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The tour took an hour and fifteen minutes. Jake enjoyed it. The museum was quiet. Even better, it was air-conditioned. And the pictures were nice. He was particularly fascinated by a small group of Frederick Remington’s Old West paintings and a large picture by Thomas Hart Benton that showed a steam locomotive charging across the great plains toward Chicago while beefy farmers in bib overalls and straw hats stood in their fields and watched. He wasn’t noticed by either of the teachers with the group until the very end. Then a pretty black woman in a severe blue suit tapped him on the shoulder and asked who he was.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake hadn’t seen her coming, and for a moment his mind froze. Without thinking about what he was doing, he reached into his pocket and closed his hand around the silver key. His mind cleared immediately, and he felt calm again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “My group is upstairs,” he said, smiling guiltily. “We’re supposed to be looking at a bunch of modern art, but I like the stuff down here a lot better, because they’re real pictures. So I sort of . . . you know . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Snuck away?” the teacher suggested. The corners of her lips twitched in a suppressed smile.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, I’d rather think of it as French leave.” These words simply popped out of his mouth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The students now staring at Jake only looked puzzled, but this time the teacher actually laughed. “Either you don’t know or have forgotten,” she said, “but in the French Foreign Legion they used to shoot deserters. I suggest you rejoin your class at once, young man.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, ma’am. Thank you. They’ll be almost done now, anyway.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What school is it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Markey Academy,” Jake said. This also just popped out.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He went upstairs, listening to the disembodied echo of foot-falls and low voices in the great space of the rotunda and wondering why he had said that. He had never heard of a place called Markey Academy in his life.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h12"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_11"><b class="calibre4">12</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    HE WAITED AWHILE IN the upstairs lobby, then noticed a guard looking at him with growing curiosity and decided it wouldn’t be wise to wait any longer—he would just have to hope the class he had joined briefly was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at his wristwatch, put an expression on his face that he hoped looked like <i class="calibre3">Gosh! Look how late it’s getting!,</i> and trotted back downstairs. The class—and the pretty black teacher who had laughed at the idea of French leave—was gone, and Jake decided it might be a good idea to get gone himself. He would walk awhile longer—slowly, in deference to the heat—and catch a subway.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stopped at a hot-dog stand on the corner of Broadway and Forty-second, trading in a little of his meager cash supply for a sweet sausage and a Nehi. He sat on the steps of a bank building to eat his lunch, and that turned out to be a bad mistake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A cop came walking toward him, twirling his night-stick in a complex series of maneuvers. He seemed to be paying attention to nothing but this, but when he came abreast of Jake he abruptly shoved his stick back into his loop and turned to him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Say-hey, big guy,” he said. “No school today?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake had been wolfing his sausage, but the last bite abruptly stuck in his throat. This was a lousy piece of luck . . . if luck was all it was. They were in Times Square, sleaze capital of America; there were pushers, junkies, whores, and chicken-chasers everywhere . . . but this cop was ignoring <i class="calibre3">them</i> in favor of <i class="calibre3">him.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake swallowed with an effort, then said, “It’s finals week at my school. I only had one test today. Then I could leave.” He paused, not liking the bright, searching look in the cop’s eyes. “I had permission,” he concluded uneasily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Uh-huh. Can I see some ID?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s heart sank. Had his mother and father already called the cops? He supposed that, after yesterday’s adventure, that was pretty likely. Under ordinary circumstances, the NYPD wouldn’t take much notice of another missing kid, especially one that had been gone only half a day, but his father was a big deal at the Network, and he prided himself on the number of strings he could pull. Jake doubted if this cop had his picture . . . but he might very well have his name.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well,” Jake said reluctantly, “I’ve got my student discount card from Mid-World Lanes, but that’s about all.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Mid-World Lanes? Never heard of it. Where’s that? Queens?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Mid-<i class="calibre3">Town,</i> I mean,” Jake thought. God, this was going north instead of south . . . and fast. “You know? On Thirty-third?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Uh-huh. That’ll do fine.” The cop held out his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A black man with dreadlocks spilling over the shoulders of his canary-yellow suit glanced over. “Bussim, ossifer!” this apparition said cheerfully. “Bussiz lil whitebread ass! Do yo duty, now!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shut up and get in the wind, Eli,” the cop said without looking around.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eli laughed, exposing several gold teeth, and moved along.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why don’t you ask <i class="calibre3">him</i> for some ID?” Jake asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because right now I’m asking you. Snap it up, son.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The cop either had his name or had sensed something wrong about him—which wasn’t so surprising, maybe, since he was the only white in the area who wasn’t obviously trolling. Either way, it came to the same: sitting down here to eat his lunch had been dumb. But his feet had hurt, and he’d been hungry, dammit—<i class="calibre3">hungry</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You’re not going to stop me, Jake thought. I can’t let you stop me. There’s someone I’m supposed to meet this afternoon in Brooklyn . . . and I’m going to be there.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Instead of reaching for his wallet, he reached into his front pocket and brought out the key. He held it up to the policeman; the late-morning sunshine bounced little coins of reflected light onto the man’s cheeks and forehead. His eyes widened.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Heyy!” he breathed. “What you got there, kid?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He reached for it, and Jake pulled the key back a little. The reflected circles of light danced hypnotically on the cop’s face. “You don’t need to take it,” Jake said. “You can read my name without doing that, can’t you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, sure.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The curiosity had left the cop’s face. He looked only at the key. His gaze was wide and fixed, but not quite empty. Jake read both amazement and unexpected happiness in his look. <i class="calibre3">That’s me</i>, Jake thought, <i class="calibre3">just spreading joy and goodwill wherever I go. The question is, what do I do now?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A young woman (probably not a librarian, judging from the green silk hotpants and see-through blouse she was wearing) came wiggle-wobbling up the sidewalk on a pair of purple fuck-me shoes with three-inch heels. She glanced first at the cop, then at Jake to see what the cop was looking at. When she got a good look, she stopped cold. One of her hands drifted up and touched her throat. A man bumped into her and told her to watch where the damn-hell she was going. The young woman who was probably not a librarian took no notice whatever. Now Jake saw that four or five other people had stopped as well. All were staring at the key. They were gathering as people sometimes will around a very good three-card-monte dealer plying his trade on a streetcorner.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You’re doing a great job of being inconspicuous, he thought. Oh yeah.</i> He glanced over the cop’s shoulder, and his eye caught a sign on the far side of the street. Denby’s Discount Drug, it said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “My name’s Tom Denby,” he told the cop. “It says so right here on my discount bowling card—right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Right, right,” the cop breathed. He had lost all interest in Jake; he was only interested in the key. The little coins of reflected light bounced and spun on his face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And you’re not looking for anybody named Tom Denby, are you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” the cop said. “Never heard of him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now there were at least half a dozen people gathered around the cop, all of them staring with silent wonder at the silver key in Jake’s hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So I can go, can’t I?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Huh? Oh! Oh, sure—go, for your father’s sake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thanks,” Jake said, but for a moment he wasn’t sure <i class="calibre3">how</i> to go. He was hemmed in by a silent crowd of zombies, and more were joining it all the time. They were only coming to see what the deal was, he realized, but the ones who saw the key just stopped dead and stared.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He got to his feet and backed slowly up the wide bank steps, holding the key out in front of him like a lion-tamer with a chair. When he got to the wide concrete plaza at the top, he stuffed it back into his pants pockets, turned, and fled.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stopped just once on the far side of the plaza, and looked back. The small group of people around the place where he had been standing was coming slowly back to life. They looked around at each other with dazed expressions, then walked on. The cop glanced vacantly to his left, to his right, and then straight up at the sky, as if trying to remember how he had gotten here and what he had been meaning to do. Jake had seen enough. It was time to find a subway station and get his ass over to Brooklyn before anything else weird could happen.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h13"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_12"><b class="calibre4">13</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    AT QUARTER OF TWO that afternoon he walked slowly up the steps of the subway station and stood on the corner of Castle and Brooklyn Avenues, looking at the sandstone towers of Co-Op City. He waited for that feeling of sureness and direction—that feeling that was like being able to remember forward in time—to overtake him. It didn’t come. <i class="calibre3">Nothing</i> came. He was just a kid standing on a hot Brooklyn street corner with his short shadow lying at his feet like a tired pet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Well, I’m here . . . now what do I do?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake discovered he didn’t have the slightest idea.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_13"><b class="calibre4">14</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND’S SMALL BAND OF travellers reached the crest of the long, gentle hill they had been climbing and stood looking southeast. For a long time none of them spoke. Susannah opened her mouth twice, then closed it again. For the first time in her life as a woman, she was completely speechless.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Before them, an almost endless plain dozed in the long golden light of a summer’s afternoon. The grass was lush, emerald green, and very high. Groves of trees with long, slender trunks and wide, spreading tops dotted the plain. Susannah had once seen similar trees, she thought, in a travelogue film about Australia.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The road they had been following swooped down the far side of the hill and then ran straight as a string into the southeast, a bright white lane cutting through the grass. To the west, some miles off, she could see a herd of large animals grazing peacefully. They looked like buffalo. To the east, the last of the forest made a curved peninsula into the grassland. This incursion was a dark, tangled shape that looked like a forearm with a cocked fist at the end.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That was the direction, she realized, in which all the creeks and streams they had encountered had been flowing. They were tributaries of the vast river that emerged from that jutting arm of forest and flowed, placid and dreaming under the summer sun, toward the eastern edge of the world. It was wide, that river—perhaps two miles from bank to bank.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And she could see the city.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It lay dead ahead, a misty collection of spires and towers rising above the far edge of the horizon. Those airy ramparts might have been a hundred miles away, or two hundred, or four hundred. The air of this world seemed to be totally clear, and that made judging distances a fool’s game. All she knew for sure was that the sight of those dim towers filled her with silent wonder . . . and a deep, aching homesickness for New York. She thought, <i class="calibre3">I believe I’d do most anything just to see the Manhattan skyline from the Triborough Bridge again.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then she had to smile, because that wasn’t the truth. The truth was that she wouldn’t trade Roland’s world for anything. Its silent mystery and empty spaces were intoxicating. And her lover was here. In New York—the New York of her own time, at least—they would have been objects of scorn and anger, the butt of every idiot’s crude, cruel jokes: a black woman of twenty-six and her whitebread lover who was three years younger and who had a tendency to talk like dis and dat when he got excited. Her whitebread lover who had been carrying a heavy monkey on his back only eight months before. Here, there was no one to jeer or laugh. Here, no one was pointing a finger. Here, there were only Roland, Eddie, and herself, the world’s last three gunslingers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She took Eddie’s hand and felt it close over hers, warm and reassuring.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland pointed. “That must be the Send River,” he said in a low voice. “I never thought to see it in my life . . . wasn’t even sure it was real, like the Guardians.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s so lovely,” Susannah murmured. She was unable to take her eyes from the vast landscape before her, dreaming richly in the cradle of summer. She found her eyes tracing the shadows of the trees, which trailed across the plain for what seemed miles as the sun sank toward the horizon. “It’s the way our Great Plains must have looked before they were settled—even before the Indians came.” She raised her free hand and pointed toward the place where the Great Road narrowed to a point. “There’s your city,” she said. “Isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It looks okay,” Eddie said. “Is that possible, Roland? Could it still be pretty much intact. Did the old-timers build that well?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Anything is possible in these times,” Roland said, but he sounded doubtful. “You shouldn’t get your hopes up, though, Eddie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Huh? No.” But Eddie’s hopes <i class="calibre3">were</i> up. That dimly sketched skyline had awakened homesickness in Susannah’s heart; in Eddie’s it kindled a sudden blaze of supposition. If the city was still there—and it clearly was—it might still be populated, and maybe not just by the subhuman things Roland had met under the mountains, either. The city-dwellers might be
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    (<i class="calibre3">Americans</i>, Eddie’s subconscious whispered)
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    intelligent and helpful; they might, in fact, spell the difference between success and failure for the quest of the pilgrims . . . or even between life and death. In Eddie’s mind a vision (partly cribbed from movies like <i class="calibre3">The Last Starfighter</i> and <i class="calibre3">The Dark Crystal</i>) gleamed brightly: a council of gnarled but dignified City Elders who would serve them a whopping meal drawn from the unspoiled stores of the city (or perhaps from special gardens cradled within environmental bubbles) and who would, as he and Roland and Susannah ate themselves silly, explain exactly what lay ahead and what it all meant. Their parting gift to the wayfarers would be an AAA-approved TourGuide map with the best route to the Dark Tower marked in red.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie did not know the phrase <i class="calibre3">deus ex machina,</i> but he knew—had now grown up enough to know—that such wise and kindly folk lived mostly in comic books and B-movies. The idea was intoxicating, all the same: an enclave of civilization in this dangerous, mostly empty world; wise old elf-men who would tell them just what the fuck it was they were supposed to be doing. And the fabulous shapes of the city disclosed in that hazy skyline made the idea seem at least possible. Even if the city was totally deserted, the population wiped out by some long-ago plague or outbreak of chemical warfare, it might still serve them as a kind of giant toolbox—a huge Army-Navy Surplus Store where they could outfit themselves for the hard passages Eddie was sure must lie ahead. Besides, he was a city boy, born and bred, and the sight of all those tall towers just naturally got him up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All <i class="calibre3">right!”</i> he said, almost laughing out loud in his excitement. “Hey-ho, let’s go! Bring on those wise fuckin elves!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah looked at him, puzzled but smiling. “What you ravin about, white boy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nothing. Never mind. I just want to get moving. What do you say, Roland? Want to—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But something on Roland’s face or just beneath it—some lost, dreaming thing—caused him to fall silent and put one arm around Susannah’s shoulders, as if to protect her.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h15"/>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_14"><b class="calibre4">15</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    AFTER ONE BRIEF, DISMISSIVE glance at the city skyline, Roland’s gaze had been caught by something a good deal closer to their current position, something that filled him with disquiet and foreboding. He had seen such things before, and the last time he’d come across one, Jake had been with him. He remembered how they had finally come out of the desert, the trail of the man in black leading them through the foothills and toward the mountains. Hard going, it had been, but at least there had been water again. And grass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One night he had awakened to find Jake gone. He had heard strangled, desperate cries coming from a willow-grove hard by a narrow trickle of stream. By the time he had fought his way through to the clearing at the center of the grove, the boy’s cries had ceased. Roland had found him standing in a place exactly like the one which lay below and ahead. A place of stones; a place of sacrifice; a place where an Oracle lived . . . and spoke when it was forced to . . . and killed whenever it could.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland?” Eddie asked. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you see that?” Roland pointed. “It’s a speaking ring. The shapes you see are tall standing stones.” He found himself staring at Eddie, whom he had first met in the frightening but wonderful air-carriage of that strange other world where the gunslingers wore blue uniforms and there was an endless supply of sugar, paper, and wonderful drugs like <i class="calibre3">astin.</i> Some strange expression—some foreknowledge—was dawning on Eddie’s face. The bright hope which had lit his eyes as he surveyed the city whiffed out, leaving him with a look both gray and bleak. It was the expression of a man studying the gallows on which he will soon be hanged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">First Jake, and now Eddie,</i> the gunslinger thought. <i class="calibre3">The wheel which turns our lives is remorseless; always it comes around to the same place again.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh shit,” Eddie said. His voice was dry and scared. “I think that’s the place where the kid is going to try and come through.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger nodded. “Very likely. They’re thin places, and they’re also <i class="calibre3">attractive</i> places. I followed him to such a place once before. The Oracle that kept there came very close to killing him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How do you <i class="calibre3">know</i> this?” Susannah asked Eddie. “Was it a dream?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He only shook his head. “I don’t know. But the minute Roland pointed that goddamn place out . . .” He broke off and looked at the gunslinger. “We have to get there, just as fast as we can.” Eddie sounded both frantic and fearful.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is it going to happen today?” Roland asked. “Tonight?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shook his head again, and licked his lips. “I don’t know that, either. Not for sure. Tonight? I don’t think so. Time . . . it isn’t the same over here as it is where the kid is. It goes slower in his where and when. Maybe tomorrow.” He had been battling panic, but now it broke free. He turned and grabbed Roland’s shirt with his cold, sweating fingers. “But I’m supposed to finish the key, and I haven’t, and I’m supposed to do something else, and I don’t have a clue about what it is. And if the kid dies, it’ll be <i class="calibre3">my fault!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger locked his own hands over Eddie’s and pulled them away from his shirt. “Get control of yourself.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland, don’t you understand—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I understand that whining and puling won’t solve your problem. I understand that you have forgotten the face of your father.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Quit that bullshit! I don’t care <i class="calibre3">dick</i> about my father!” Eddie shouted hysterically, and Roland hit him across the face. His hand made a sound like a breaking branch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie’s head rocked back; his eyes widened with shock. He stared at the gunslinger, then slowly raised his hand to touch the reddening handprint on his cheek. “You <i class="calibre3">bastard!”</i> he whispered. His hand dropped to the butt of the revolver he still wore on his left hip. Susannah tried to put her own hands over it; Eddie pushed them away.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">And now I must teach again,</i> Roland thought, <i class="calibre3">only this time I teach for my own life, I think, as well as for his.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Somewhere in the distance a crow hailed its harsh cry into the stillness, and Roland thought for a moment of his hawk, David. Now <i class="calibre3">Eddie</i> was his hawk . . . and like David, he would not scruple to tear out his eye if he gave so much as a single inch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Or his throat.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Will you shoot me? Is that how you’d have it end, Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Man, I’m so fucking tired of your jive,” Eddie said. His eyes were blurred with tears and fury.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You haven’t finished the key, but not because you are afraid to finish. You’re afraid of finding you <i class="calibre3">can’t</i> finish. You’re afraid to go down to where the stones stand, but not because you’re afraid of what may come once you enter the circle. You’re afraid of what may <i class="calibre3">not</i> come. You’re not afraid of the great world, Eddie, but of the small one inside yourself. You haven’t forgotten the face of your father. So do it. Shoot me if you dare. I’m tired of watching you blubber.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stop it!” Susannah screamed at him. “Can’t you see he’ll do it? Can’t you see you’re <i class="calibre3">forcing</i> him to do it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland cut his eyes toward her. “I’m forcing him to <i class="calibre3">decide</i>.” He looked back at Eddie, and his deeply lined face was stern. “You have come from the shadow of the heroin and the shadow of your brother, my friend. Come from the shadow of yourself, if you dare. Come now. Come out or shoot me <i class="calibre3">and have done with it.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment he thought Eddie was going to do just that, and it would all end right here, on this high ridge, beneath a cloudless summer sky with the spires of the city glimmering on the horizon like blue ghosts. Then Eddie’s cheek began to twitch. The firm line of his lips softened and began to tremble. His hand fell from the sandalwood butt of Roland’s gun. His chest hitched once . . . twice . . . three times. His mouth opened and all his despair and terror came out in one groaning cry as he blundered toward the gunslinger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“I’m</i> afraid<i class="calibre3">, you numb fuck! Don’t you understand that? Roland,</i> I’m afraid!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His feet tangled together. He fell forward. Roland caught him and held him close, smelling the sweat and dirt on his skin, smelling his tears and terror.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger embraced him for a moment, then turned him toward Susannah. Eddie dropped to his knees beside her chair, his head hanging wearily. She put a hand on the back of his neck, pressing his head against her thigh, and said bitterly to Roland, “Sometimes I hate you, big white man.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland placed the heels of his hands against his forehead and pressed hard. “Sometimes I hate myself.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t ever stop you, though, do it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland didn’t reply. He looked at Eddie, who lay with his cheek pressed against Susannah’s thigh and his eyes tightly shut. His face was a study in misery. Roland fought away the dragging weariness that made him want to leave the rest of this charming discussion for another day. If Eddie was right, there <i class="calibre3">was</i> no other day. Jake was almost ready to make his move. Eddie had been chosen to midwife the boy into this world. If he wasn’t prepared to do that, Jake would die at the point of entry, as surely as an infant must strangle if the mother-root is tangled about its neck when the contractions begin.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stand up, Eddie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment he thought Eddie would simply go on crouching there and hiding his face against the woman’s leg. If so, everything was lost . . . and that was <i class="calibre3">ka,</i> too. Then, slowly, Eddie got to his feet. He stood there with everything—hands, shoulders, head, hair—hanging, not good, but he was up, and that was a start.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look at me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah stirred uneasily, but this time she said nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Slowly, Eddie raised his head and brushed the hair out of his eyes with a trembling hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This is for you. I was wrong to take it at all, no matter how deep my pain.” Roland curled his hand around the rawhide strip and yanked, snapping it. He held the key out to Eddie. Eddie reached for it like a man in a dream, but Roland did not immediately open his hand. “Will you try to do what needs to be done?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” His voice was almost inaudible.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you have something to tell me?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m sorry I’m afraid.” There was something terrible in Eddie’s voice, something which hurt Roland’s heart and, he supposed, he knew what it was: here was the last of Eddie’s childhood, expiring painfully among the three of them. It could not be seen, but Roland could hear its weakening cries. He tried to make himself deaf to them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Something else I’ve done in the name of the Tower. My score grows ever longer, and the day when it will all have to be totted up, like a long-time drunkard’s bill in an alehouse, draws ever nearer. How will I ever pay?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t want your apology, least of all for being afraid,” he said. “Without fear, what would we be? Mad dogs with foam on our muzzles and shit drying on our hocks.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What <i class="calibre3">do</i> you want, then?” Eddie cried. “You’ve taken everything else—everything I have to give! No, not even that, because in the end, I gave it to you! So <i class="calibre3">what else do you want from me?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland held the key which was their half of Jake Chambers’s salvation locked in his fist and said nothing. His eyes held Eddie’s, and the sun shone on the green expanse of plain and the blue-gray reach of the Send River, and somewhere in the distance the crow hailed again across the golden leagues of this fading summer afternoon.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    After a while, understanding began to dawn in Eddie Dean’s eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I have forgotten the face . . .” Eddie paused. Dipped his head. Swallowed. Looked up at the gunslinger once more. The thing which had been dying among them had moved on now—Roland knew it. That thing was gone. Just like that. Here, on this sunny wind-swept ridge at the edge of everything, it had gone forever. “I have forgotten the face of my father, gunslinger . . . and I cry your pardon.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland opened his hand and returned the small burden of the key to him who <i class="calibre3">ka</i> had decreed must carry it. “Speak not so, gunslinger,” he said in the High Speech. “Your father sees you very well . . . loves you very well . . . and so do I.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie closed his own hand over the key and turned away with his tears still drying on his face. “Let’s go,” he said, and they began to move down the long hill toward the plain which stretched beyond.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE WALKED SLOWLY ALONG Castle Avenue, past pizza shops and bars and bodegas where old women with suspicious faces poked the potatoes and squeezed the tomatoes. The straps of his pack had chafed the skin beneath his arms, and his feet hurt. He passed beneath a digital thermometer which announced it was eighty-five. It felt more like a hundred and five to Jake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Up ahead, a police car turned onto the Avenue. Jake at once became extremely interested in a display of gardening supplies in the window of a hardware store. He watched the reflection of the blue-and-white pass in the window and didn’t move until it was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Hey, Jake, old buddy—where, exactly, are you going?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He hadn’t the slightest idea. He felt positive that the boy he was looking for—the boy in the green bandanna and the yellow T-shirt that said NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN MID-WORLD—was somewhere close by, but so what? To Jake he was still nothing but a needle hiding in the haystack which was Brooklyn.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He passed an alley which had been decorated with a tangle of spray-painted graffiti. Mostly they were names—EL TIANTE 91, SPEEDY GONZALES, MOTORVAN MIKE—but a few mottos and words to the wise had been dropped in here and there, and Jake’s eyes fixed on two of these.
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="ctag">
      <b class="calibre4">A ROSE IS A ROSE IS A ROSE</b>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    had been written across the bricks in spray-paint which had weathered to the same dusky-pink shade of the rose which grew in the vacant lot where Tom and Gerry’s Artistic Deli had once stood. Below it, in a blue so dark it was almost black, someone had spray-painted this oddity:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="ctag">
        <b class="calibre4">I CRY YOUR PARDON</b>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What does that mean?</i> Jake wondered. He didn’t know—something from the Bible, maybe—but it held like the eye of a snake is reputed to hold a bird. At last he walked on, slowly and thoughtfully. It was almost two-thirty, and his shadow was beginning to grow longer.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Just ahead, he saw an old man walking down the street, keeping to the shade as much as possible and leaning on a gnarled cane. Behind the thick glasses he wore, his brown eyes swam like oversized eggs.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I cry your pardon, sir,” Jake said without thinking or even really hearing himself.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The old man turned to look at him, blinking in surprise and fear. “Liff me alone, boy,” he said. He raised his walking-stick and brandished it clumsily in Jake’s direction.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Would you know if there’s a place called Markey Academy anyplace around here, sir?” This was utter desperation, but it was the only thing he could think to ask.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The old man slowly lowered his stick—it was the <i class="calibre3">sir</i> that had done it. He looked at Jake with the slightly lunatic interest of the old and almost senile. “How come you not in school, boy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake smiled wearily. This one was getting very old. “Finals Week. I came down here to look up an old friend of mine who goes to Markey Academy, that’s all. Sorry to have bothered you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stepped around the old man (hoping he wouldn’t decide to whop him one across the ass with his cane just for good luck) and was almost down to the corner when the old man yelled: “Boy! <i class="calibre3">Boyyyyy!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned around.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There is no Markey Akidimy down here,” the old man said. “Twenty-two years I’m living here, so I should know. Markey <i class="calibre3">Avenue</i>, yes, but no Markey Akidimy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s stomach cramped with sudden excitement. He took a step back toward the old man, who at once raised his cane into a defensive position again. Jake stopped at once, leaving a twenty-foot safety zone between them. “Where’s Markey Avenue, sir? Can you tell me that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Of <i class="calibre3">gorse</i>,” the old man said. “Didn’t I just say I’m livink here twenty-two years? Two blogs down. Turn left at the Majestic Theatre. But I’m tellink you now, there iss no Markey Akidimy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thank you, sir! Thank you!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned around and looked up Castle Avenue. Yes—he could see the unmistakable shape of a movie marquee jutting out over the sidewalk a couple of blocks up. He started to run toward it, then decided that might attract attention and slowed down to a fast walk.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The old man watched him go. <i class="calibre3">“Sir!”</i> he said to himself in a tone of mild amazement. <i class="calibre3">“Sir,</i> yet!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He chuckled rustily and moved on.

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND’S BAND STOPPED AT dusk. The gunslinger dug a shallow pit and lit a fire. They didn’t need it for cooking purposes, but they needed it, nonetheless. <i class="calibre3">Eddie</i> needed it. If he was going to finish his carving, he would need light to work by.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger looked around and saw Susannah, a dark silhouette against the fading aquamarine sky, but he didn’t see Eddie.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Where is he?” he asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Down the road apiece. You leave him alone now, Roland—you’ve done enough.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded, bent over the firepit, and struck at a piece of flint with a worn steel bar. Soon the kindling he had gathered was blazing. He added small sticks, one by one, and waited for Eddie to return.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h18"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_17"><b class="calibre4">18</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    HALF A MILE BACK the way they had come, Eddie sat cross-legged in the middle of the Great Road with his unfinished key in one hand, watching the sky. He glanced down the road, saw the spark of the fire, and knew exactly what Roland was doing . . . and why. Then he turned his gaze to the sky again. He had never felt so lonely or so afraid.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The sky was <i class="calibre3">huge</i>—he could not remember ever seeing so much uninterrupted space, so much pure emptiness. It made him feel very small, and he supposed there was nothing at all wrong with that. In the scheme of things, he <i class="calibre3">was</i> very small.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The boy was close now. He thought he knew where Jake was and what he was about to do, and it filled him with silent wonder. Susannah had come from 1963. Eddie had come from 1987. Between them . . . Jake. Trying to come over. Trying to be born.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I met him</i>, Eddie thought. <i class="calibre3">I must have met him, and I think I remember . . . sort of. It was just before Henry went into the Army, right? He was taking courses at Brooklyn Vocational Institute, and he was heavily into black—black jeans, black motorcycle boots with steel caps, black T-shirts with the sleeves rolled up. Henry’s James Dean look. Smoking Area Chic. I used to think that, but I never said it out loud, because I didn’t want him pissed at me.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He realized that what he had been waiting for had happened while he was thinking: Old Star had come out. In fifteen minutes, maybe less, it would be joined by a whole galaxy of alien jewelry, but for now it gleamed alone in the ungathered darkness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie slowly held up the key until Old Star gleamed within its wide central notch. And then he recited the old formula of his world, the one his mother had taught him as she knelt beside him at the bedroom window, both of them looking out at the evening star which rode the oncoming darkness above the rooftops and fire-escapes of Brooklyn: “Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight; wish I may, wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Old Star glowed in the notch of the key, a diamond caught in ash.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Help me find some guts,” Eddie said. “That’s my wish. Help me find the guts to try and finish this damned thing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He sat there a moment longer, then got to his feet and walked slowly back to camp. He sat down as close to the fire as he could get, took the gunslinger’s knife without a word to either him or Susannah, and began to work. Tiny, curling slivers of wood rolled up from the <i class="calibre3">s</i>-shape at the end of the key. Eddie worked fast, turning the key this way and that, occasionally closing his eyes and letting his thumb slip along the mild curves. He tried not to think about what might happen if the shape were to go wrong—that would freeze him for sure.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland and Susannah sat behind him, watching silently. At last Eddie put the knife aside. His face was running with sweat. “This kid of yours,” he said. “This Jake. He must be a gutty brat.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He was brave under the mountains,” Roland said. “He was afraid, but never gave an inch.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I wish I could be that way.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shrugged. “At Balazar’s you fought well even though they had taken your clothes. It’s very hard for a man to fight naked, but you did it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie tried to remember the shootout in the nightclub, but it was just a blur in his mind—smoke, noise, and light shining through one wall in confused, intersecting rays. He thought that wall had been torn apart by automatic-weapons fire, but couldn’t remember for sure.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He held the key up so its notches were sharply outlined against the flames. He held it that way for a long time, looking mostly at the <i class="calibre3">s</i>-shape. It looked exactly as he remembered it from his dream and from the momentary vision he had seen in the fire . . . but it didn’t feel exactly right. Almost, but not quite.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That’s just Henry again. That’s just all those years of never being quite good enough. You did it, buddy—it’s just that the Henry inside doesn’t want to admit it</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He dropped the key onto the square of hide and folded the edges carefully around it. “I’m done. I don’t know if it’s right or not, but I guess it’s as right as I can make it.” He felt oddly empty now that he no longer had the key to work on—purposeless and directionless.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you want something to eat, Eddie?” Susannah asked quietly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">There’s your purpose, he thought. There’s your direction. Sitting right over there, with her hands folded in her lap. All the purpose and direction you’ll ever—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But now something else rose in his mind—it came all at once. Not a dream . . . not a vision . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No, not either of those. It’s a memory. It’s happening again—you’re remembering forward in time</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I have to do something else first,” he said, and got up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    On the far side of the fire, Roland had stacked some odd lots of scavenged wood. Eddie hunted through them and found a dry stick about two feet long and four inches or so through the middle. He took it, returning to his place by the fire, and picked up Roland’s knife again. This time he worked faster because he was simply sharpening the stick, turning it into something that looked like a small tent-peg.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Can we get moving before daybreak?” he asked the gunslinger. “I think we should get to that circle as soon as we can.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Sooner, if we must. I don’t want to move in the dark—a speaking ring is an unsafe place to be at night—but if we have to, we have to.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “From the look on your face, big boy, I doubt if those stone circles are very safe <i class="calibre3">any</i> time,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie put the knife aside again. The dirt Roland had taken out of the shallow hole he’d made for the campfire was piled up by Eddie’s right foot. Now he used the sharp end of the stick to carve a question-mark shape in the dirt. The shape was crisp and clear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay,” he said, brushing it away. “All done.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Have something to eat, then,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie tried, but he wasn’t very hungry. When he finally went to sleep, nestled against Susannah’s warmth, his rest was dreamless but very thin. Until the gunslinger shook him awake at four in the morning, he heard the wind racing endlessly over the plain below them, and it seemed to him that he went with it, flying high into the night, away from these cares, while Old Star and Old Mother rode serenely above him, painting his cheeks with frost.

  <div class="tx">
    “IT’S TIME,” ROLAND SAID.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie sat up. Susannah sat up beside him, rubbing her palms over her face. As Eddie’s head cleared, his mind was filled with urgency. “Yes. Let’s go, and fast. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He’s getting close, isn’t he?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Very close.” Eddie got to his feet, grasped Susannah around the waist, and boosted her into her chair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She was looking at him anxiously. “Do we still have enough time to get there?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie nodded. “Barely.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Three minutes later they were headed down the Great Road again. It glimmered ahead of them like a ghost. And an hour after that, as the first light of dawn began to touch the sky in the east, a rhythmic sound began far ahead of them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The sound of drums, Roland thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Machinery, Eddie thought. Some huge piece of machinery.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s a heart, Susannah thought. Some huge, diseased, beating heart . . . and it’s in that city, where we have to go.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Two hours later, the sound stopped as suddenly as it had begun. White, featureless clouds had begun to fill the sky above them, first veiling the early sun, then blotting it out. The circle of standing stones lay less than five miles ahead now, gleaming in the shadowless light like the teeth of a fallen monster.

    A gum-chewing cutie with rollers in her blonde hair sat in the box office listening to Led Zep on her transistor and reading one of the tabloids of which Mrs. Shaw was so fond. To her left, in the theater’s remaining display case, there was a poster showing Clint Eastwood.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake knew he should get moving—three o’clock was almost here—but he paused a moment anyway, staring at the poster behind the dirty, cracked glass. East-wood was wearing a Mexican serape. A cigar was clamped in his teeth. He had thrown one side of the serape back over his shoulder to free his gun. His eyes were a pale, faded blue. Bombardier’s eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s not him, Jake thought, but it’s almost him. It’s the eyes, mostly . . . the eyes are almost the same.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You let me drop,” he said to the man in the old poster, the man who was not Roland. “You let me die. What happens this time?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hey, kid,” the blonde ticket-seller called, making Jake start. “You gonna come in or just stand there and talk to yourself?”

  </div>

  <div class="tx1">

  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Once again he waited for the feeling of <i class="calibre3">remembering forward</i> to seize him, but it didn’t come. This was just a hot, sunny street lined with sandstone-colored apartment buildings that looked like prison cellblocks to Jake. A few young women were walking along, pushing baby-carriages in pairs and talking desultorily, but the street was otherwise deserted. It was unseasonably hot for May—too hot to stroll.

    From behind him came a burst of raucous male laughter. It was followed by an outraged female shriek: “You give that <i class="calibre3">back</i>!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake jumped, thinking the owner of the voice must mean him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Give it <i class="calibre3">back,</i> Henry! I’m not kidding!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned and saw two boys, one at least eighteen and the other a lot younger . . . twelve or thirteen. At the sight of this second boy, Jake’s heart did something that felt like a loop-the-loop in his chest. The kid was wearing green corduroys instead of madras shorts, but the yellow T-shirt was the same, and he had a battered old basketball under one arm. Although his back was to Jake, Jake knew he had found the boy from last night’s dream.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_20"><b class="calibre4">21</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE GIRL WAS THE gum-chewing cutie from the ticket-booth. The older of the two boys—who looked almost old enough to be called a man—had her newspaper in his hands. She grabbed for it. The newspaper-grabber—he was wearing denims and a black T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up—held it over his head and grinned.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jump for it, Maryanne! Jump, girl, jump!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She stared at him with angry eyes, her cheeks flushed. “Give it to me!” she said. “Quit fooling around and give it back! <i class="calibre3">Bastard!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oooo wisten to <i class="calibre3">dat,</i> Eddie!” the old kid said. “Bad wang-gwidge! Naughty, naughty!” He waved the newspaper just out of the blonde ticket-seller’s grasp, grinning, and Jake suddenly understood. These two were walking home from school together—although they probably didn’t go to the same one, if he was right about the difference in their ages—and the bigger boy had gone over to the box office, pretending he had something interesting to tell the blonde. Then he had reached through the slot at the bottom and snatched her paper.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The big boy’s face was one that Jake had seen before; it was the face of a kid who would think it the height of hilarity to douse a cat’s tail with lighter fluid or feed a bread-ball with a fishhook planted in the middle to a hungry dog. The sort of kid who sat in the back of the room and snapped bra-straps and then said “Who me?” with a big, dumb look of surprise on his face when someone finally complained. There weren’t many kids like him at Piper, but there were a few. Jake supposed there were a few in every school. They dressed better at Piper, but the face was the same. He guessed that in the old days, people would have said it was the face of a boy who was born to be hung.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Maryanne jumped for her newspaper, which the old boy in the black pants had rolled into a tube. He pulled it out of her reach just before she could grab it, then whacked her on the head with it, the way you might whack a dog for piddling on the carpet. She was beginning to cry now—mostly from humiliation, Jake guessed. Her face was now so red it was almost glowing. “Keep it, then!” she yelled at him. “I know you can’t read, but you can look at the pictures, at least!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She began to turn away.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Give it back, why don’t you?” the younger boy—Jake’s boy—said softly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The old boy held out the newspaper tube. The girl snatched it from him, and even from his place thirty feet farther down the street, Jake heard it rip. “You’re a turd, Henry Dean!” she cried. “A real <i class="calibre3">turd!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hey, what’s the big deal?” Henry sounded genuinely injured. “It was just a joke. Besides, it only ripped in one place—you can still read it, for Chrissake. Lighten up a little, why don’tcha?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And that was right, too, Jake thought. Guys like this Henry always pushed even the most unfunny joke two steps too far . . . then looked wounded and misunderstood when someone yelled at them. And it was always <i class="calibre3">Wassa matter?</i> and it was <i class="calibre3">Can’tcha take a joke?</i> and it was <i class="calibre3">Why don’tcha lighten up a little?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What are you doing with him, kid? Jake wondered. If you’re on my side, what are you doing with a jerk like that?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But as the younger kid turned around and they started to walk down the street again, Jake knew. The old boy’s features were heavier, and his complexion was badly pitted with acne, but otherwise the resemblance was striking. The two boys were brothers.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h22"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_21"><b class="calibre4">22</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE TURNED AWAY AND began to idle up the sidewalk ahead of the two boys. He reached into his breast pocket with a shaky hand, pulled out his father’s sunglasses, and managed to fumble them onto his face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Voices swelled behind him, as if someone was gradually turning up the volume on a radio.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You shouldn’t have ranked on her that bad, Henry. It was mean.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “She loves it, Eddie.” Henry’s voice was complacent, worldly-wise “When you get a little older, you’ll understand.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “She was <i class="calibre3">cryin.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Prob’ly got the rag on,” Henry said in a philosophical tone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They were very close now. Jake shrank against the side of the building. His head was down, his hands stuffed deep into the pockets of his jeans. He didn’t know why it seemed so vitally important that he not be noticed, but it did. Henry didn’t matter, one way or the other, but—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The younger one isn’t supposed to remember me, he thought. I don’t know why, exactly, but he’s not.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They passed him without so much as a glance, the one Henry had called Eddie walking on the outside, dribbling the basketball along the gutter.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You gotta admit she looked funny,” Henry was saying. “Ole Be-Bop Maryanne, jumpin for her newspaper. Woof! Woof!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked up at his brother with an expression that wanted to be reproachful . . . and then he gave up and dissolved into laughter. Jake saw the unconditional love in that upturned face and guessed that Eddie would forgive a lot in his big brother before giving it up as a bad job.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So are we going?” Eddie asked now. “You said we could. After school.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I said <i class="calibre3">maybe</i>. I dunno if I wanna walk all the way over there. Mom’ll be home by now, too. Maybe we just oughtta forget it. Go upstairs and watch some tube.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They were now ten feet ahead of Jake and pulling away.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ah, come on! You <i class="calibre3">said!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Beyond the building the two boys were currently passing was a chainlink fence with an open gate in it. Beyond it, Jake saw, was the playground of which he had dreamed last night . . . a version of it, anyway. It wasn’t surrounded by trees, and there was no odd subway kiosk with diagonal slashes of yellow and black across the front, but the cracked concrete was the same. So were the faded yellow foul lines.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well . . . maybe. I dunno.” Jake realized Henry was teasing again. Eddie didn’t, though; he was too anxious about wherever it was he wanted to go. “Let’s shoot some hoops while I think it over.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stole the ball from his younger brother, dribbled clumsily onto the playground, and went for a lay-up that hit high on the backboard and bounced back without even touching the rim of the hoop. Henry was good at stealing newspapers from teenage girls, Jake thought, but on the basketball court he sucked the big one.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie walked in through the gate, unbuttoned his corduroy pants, and slipped them down. Beneath them were the faded madras shorts he had been wearing in Jake’s dream.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, is he wearing his shortie panties?” Henry said. “Ain’t they <i class="calibre3">cuuute?”</i> He waited until his brother balanced himself on one leg to pull off his cords, then flung the basketball at him. Eddie managed to bat it away, probably saving himself a bloody nose, but he lost his balance and fell clumsily to the concrete. He didn’t cut himself, but he could have done so, Jake saw; a great deal of broken glass glittered in the sun along the chainlink.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, Henry, quit it,” he said, but with no real reproach. Jake guessed Henry had been pulling shit like this on him so long that Eddie only noticed it when Henry pulled it on someone else—someone like the blonde ticket-seller.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Tum on, Henwy, twit it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie got to his feet and trotted out onto the court. The ball had struck the chainlink fence and bounced back to Henry. Henry now tried to dribble past his younger brother. Eddie’s hand went out, lightning-quick but oddly delicate, and stole the ball. He easily ducked under Henry’s outstretched, flailing arm and went for the basket. Henry dogged him, frowning thunderously, but he might as well have been taking a nap. Eddie went up, knees bent, feet neatly cocked, and laid the ball in. Henry grabbed it and dribbled out to the stripe.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Shouldn’t have done that, Eddie,</i> Jake thought. He was standing just beyond the place where the fence ended, watching the two boys. This seemed safe enough, at least for the moment. He was wearing his dad’s sunglasses, and the two boys were so involved in what they were doing that they wouldn’t have noticed if President Carter had strolled up to watch. Jake doubted if Henry knew who President Carter was, anyway.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He expected Henry to foul his brother, perhaps heavily, as a payback for the steal, but he had underestimated Eddie’s guile. Henry offered a head-fake that wouldn’t have fooled Jake’s mother, but Eddie appeared to fall for it. Henry broke past him and drove for the basket, gaily travelling the ball most of the way. Jake was quite sure Eddie could have caught him easily and stolen the ball again, but instead of doing so, the kid hung back. Henry laid it up—clumsily—and the ball bounced off the rim again. Eddie grabbed it . . . and then let it squirt through his fingers. Henry snatched it, turned, and put it through the netless hoop.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “One-up,” Henry panted. “Play to twelve?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sure.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake had seen enough. It would be close, but in the end Henry would win. Eddie would see to it. It would do more than save him from getting lumped up; it would put Henry in a good mood, making him more agreeable to whatever it was Eddie wanted to do.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Hey Moose—I think your little brother has been playing you like a violin for a long time now, and you don’t have the slightest idea, do you?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He drew back until the apartment building which stood at the north end of the court cut off his view of the Dean brothers, and their view of him. He leaned against the wall and listened to the thump of the ball on the court. Soon Henry was puffing like Charlie the Choo-Choo going up a steep hill. He would be a smoker, of course; guys like Henry were always smokers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The game took almost ten minutes, and by the time Henry claimed victory, the street was filled up with other home-going kids. A few gave Jake curious glances as they passed by.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good game, Henry,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not bad,” Henry panted. “You’re still falling for the old head-fake.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Sure he is, Jake thought. I think he’ll go on falling for it until he’s gained about eighty pounds. Then you might get a surprise.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I guess I am. Hey, Henry, can’t we <i class="calibre3">please</i> go look at the place?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah, why not? Let’s do it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All <i class="calibre3">right!”</i> Eddie yelled. There was the smacking sound of flesh on flesh; probably Eddie giving his brother a high-five. “Boss!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You go on up to the apartment. Tell Mom we’ll be in by four-thirty, quarter of five. But don’t say anything about The Mansion. She’d have a shit-fit. She thinks it’s haunted, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You want me to tell her we’re going over Dewey’s?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Silence as Henry considered this. “Naw. She might call Mrs. Bunkowski. Tell her . . . tell her we’re goin down to Dahlie’s to get Hoodsie Rockets. She’ll believe that. Ask her for a coupla bucks, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “She won’t give me any money. Not two days before payday.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Bullshit. You can get it out of her. Go on, now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay.” But Jake didn’t hear Eddie moving. “Henry?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“What?”</i> Impatiently.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Is</i> The Mansion haunted, do you think?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake sidled a little closer to the playground. He didn’t want to be noticed, but he strongly felt that he needed to hear this.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Naw. There ain’t no <i class="calibre3">real</i> haunted houses—just in the fuckin movies.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh.” There was unmistakable relief in Eddie’s voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But if there ever <i class="calibre3">was</i> one,” Henry resumed (perhaps he didn’t want his little brother feeling <i class="calibre3">too</i> relieved, Jake thought), “it’d be The Mansion. I heard that a couple of years ago, two kids from Norwood Street went in there to bump uglies and the cops found em with their throats cut and all the blood drained out of their bodies. But there wasn’t any blood on em or around em. Get it? The blood was all <i class="calibre3">gone.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You shittin me?” Eddie breathed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nope. But that wasn’t the worst thing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What was?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Their hair was dead white,” Henry said. The voice that drifted to Jake was solemn. He had an idea that Henry wasn’t teasing this time, that this time he believed every word he was saying. (He also doubted that Henry had brains enough to make such a story up.) “Both of em. And their eyes were wide open and staring, like they saw the most gross-awful thing in the world.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Aw, gimme a break,” Eddie said, but his voice was soft, awed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You still wanna go?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sure. As long as we don’t . . . you know, hafta get too close.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Then go see Mom. And try to get a couple of bucks out of her. I need cigarettes. Take the fuckin ball up, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake drifted backward and stepped into the nearest apartment building entryway just as Eddie came out through the playground gate.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    To his horror, the boy in the yellow T-shirt turned in Jake’s direction. <i class="calibre3">Holy crow!</i> he thought, dismayed. <i class="calibre3">What if this is his building?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was. Jake just had time to turn around and begin to scan the names beside the rank of buzzers before Eddie Dean brushed past him, so close that Jake could smell the sweat he had worked up on the basketball court. He half-sensed, half-saw the curious glance the boy tossed in his direction. Then Eddie was in the lobby and headed for the elevators with his school-pants bundled under one arm and the scuffed basketball under the other.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s heart was thudding heavily in his chest. Shadowing people was a lot harder in real life than it was in the detective novels he sometimes read. He crossed the street and stood between two apartment buildings half a block up. From here he could see both the entrance to the Dean brothers’ building and the playground. The playground was filling up now, mostly with little kids. Henry leaned against the chainlink, smoking a cigarette and trying to look full of teenage angst. Every now and then he would stick out a foot as one of the little kids bolted toward him at an all-out run, and before Eddie returned, he had succeeded in tripping three of them. The last of these went sprawling full-length, smacking his face on the concrete, and ran wailing up the street with a bloody forehead. Henry flicked his cigarette butt after him and laughed cheerfully.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Just an all-around fun guy</i>, Jake thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    After that, the little kids wised up and began giving him a wide berth. Henry strolled out of the playground and down the street to the apartment building Eddie had entered five minutes before. As he reached it, the door opened and Eddie came out. He had changed into a pair of jeans and a fresh T-shirt; he had also tied a green bandanna, the same one he had been wearing in Jake’s dream, around his forehead. He was waving a couple of dollar bills triumphantly. Henry snatched them, then asked Eddie something. Eddie nodded, and the two boys set off.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Keeping half a block between himself and them, Jake followed.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_22"><b class="calibre4">23</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THEY STOOD IN THE high grass at the edge of the Great Road, looking at the speaking ring.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Stonehenge,</i> Susannah thought, and shuddered. <i class="calibre3">That’s what it looks like. Stonehenge.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Although the thick grass which covered the plain grew around the bases of the tall gray monoliths, the circle they enclosed was bare earth, littered here and there with white things.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What are those?” she asked in a low voice. “Chips of stone?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look again,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She did, and saw that they were bones. The bones of small animals, maybe. She hoped.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie switched the sharpened stick to his left hand, dried the palm of his right against his shirt, and then switched it back again. He opened his mouth, but no sound came from his dry throat. He cleared it and tried again. “I think I’m supposed to go in and draw something in the dirt.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “Now?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Soon.” He looked into Roland’s face. “There’s something here, isn’t there? Something we can’t see.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s not here right now,” Roland said. “At least, I don’t <i class="calibre3">think</i> it is. But it will come. Our <i class="calibre3">khef—our</i> lifeforce—will draw it. And, of course, it will be jealous of its place. Give me my gun back, Eddie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie unbuckled the belt and handed it over. Then he turned back to the circle of twenty-foot-high stones. Something lived in there, all right. He could smell it, a stench that made him think of damp plaster and moldering sofas and ancient mattresses rotting beneath half-liquid coats of mildew. It was familiar, that smell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The Mansion—I smelled it there. The day I talked Henry into taking me over to see The Mansion on Rhinehold Street, in Dutch Hill.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland buckled his gunbelt, then bent to knot the tiedown. He looked up at Susannah as he did it. “We may need Detta Walker,” he said. “Is she around?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That bitch always around.” Susannah wrinkled her nose.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good. One of us is going to have to protect Eddie while he does what he’s supposed to do. The other is going to be so much useless baggage. This is a demon’s place. Demons are not human, but they are male and female, just the same. Sex is both their weapon and their weakness. No matter what the sex of the demon may be, it will go for Eddie. To protect its place. To keep its place from being used by an outsider. Do you understand?”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <br class="calibre2"/>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah nodded. Eddie appeared not to be listening. He had tucked the square of hide containing the key into his shirt and now he was staring into the speaking ring as if hypnotized.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There’s no time to say this in a gentle or refined way,” Roland told her. “One of us will—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “One of us gonna have to fuck it to keep it off Eddie,” Susannah interrupted. “This the sort of thing can’t <i class="calibre3">ever</i> turn down a free fuck. That’s what you’re gettin at, isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her eyes gleamed. They were the eyes of Detta Walker now, both wise and unkind, shining with hard amusement, and her voice slid steadily deeper into the bogus Southern plantation drawl which was Detta’s trademark. “If it’s a girl demon, you git it. But if it’s a boy demon, it’s mine. That about it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What about if it swings both ways? What about <i class="calibre3">that</i>, big boy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland’s lips twitched in the barest suggestion of a smile. “Then we’ll take it together. Just remember—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Beside them, in a fainting, distant voice, Eddie murmured: “Not all is silent in the halls of the dead. Behold, the sleeper wakes.” He turned his haunted, terrified eyes on Roland. “There’s a monster.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The demon—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. A <i class="calibre3">monster</i>. Something between the doors—between the <i class="calibre3">worlds</i>. Something that waits. <i class="calibre3">And it’s opening its eyes.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah cast a frightened glance at Roland.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stand, Eddie,” Roland said. “Be true.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie drew a deep breath. “I’ll stand until it knocks me down,” he said. “I have to go in now. It’s starting to happen.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We all goin in,” Susannah said. She arched her back and slipped out of her wheelchair. “Any demon want to fuck wit’ me he goan find out he’s fuckin wit’ the finest. I th’ow him a fuck he ain’t <i class="calibre3">never</i> goan f’git.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As they passed between two of the tall stones and into the speaking circle, it began to rain.

  <div class="tx">
    As SOON AS JAKE saw the place, he understood two things: first, that he had seen it before, in dreams so terrible his conscious mind would not let him remember them; second, that it was a place of death and murder and madness. He was standing on the far corner of Rhinehold Street and Brooklyn Avenue, seventy yards from Henry and Eddie Dean, but even from where he was he could feel The Mansion ignoring them and reaching for him with its eager invisible hands. He thought there were talons at the ends of those hands. Sharp ones.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It wants me, and I can’t run away. It’s death to go in . . . but it’s madness not to. Because somewhere inside that place is a locked door. I have the key that will open it, and the only salvation I can hope for is on the other side.</i>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stared at The Mansion, a house that almost screamed abnormality, with a sinking heart. It stood in the center of its weedy, rioting yard like a tumor.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Dean brothers had walked across nine blocks of Brooklyn, moving slowly under the hot afternoon sun, and had finally entered a section of town which had to be Dutch Hill, given the names on the shops and stores. Now they stood halfway down the block, in front of The Mansion. It looked as if it had been deserted for years, yet it had suffered remarkably little vandalism. And once, Jake thought, it really <i class="calibre3">had</i> been a mansion—the home, perhaps, of a wealthy merchant and his large family. In those long-gone days it must have been white, but now it was a dirty gray no-color. The windows had been knocked out and the peeling picket fence which surrounded it had been spray-painted, but the house itself was still intact.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It slumped in the hot light, a ramshackle slate-roofed revenant growing out of a hummocky trash-littered yard, somehow making Jake think of a dangerous dog which pretended to be asleep. Its steep roof overhung the front porch like a beetling brow. The boards of the porch were splintery and warped. Shutters which might once have been green leaned askew beside the glassless windows; ancient curtains still hung in some of these, dangling like strips of dead skin. To the left, an elderly trellis leaned away from the building, now held up not by nails but only by the nameless and somehow filthy clusters of vine which crawled over it. There was a sign on the lawn and another on the door. From where Jake stood, he could read neither of them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The house was <i class="calibre3">alive.</i> He knew this, could feel its awareness reaching out from the boards and the slumping roof, could feel it pouring in rivers from the black sockets of its windows. The idea of approaching that terrible place filled him with dismay; the idea of actually going inside filled him with inarticulate horror. Yet he would have to. He could hear a low, slumbrous buzzing in his ears—the sound of a beehive on a hot summer day—and for a moment he was afraid he might faint. He closed his eyes . . . and <i class="calibre3">his</i> voice filled his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You</i> must <i class="calibre3">come, Jake. This is the path of the Beam</i>, <i class="calibre3">the way of the Tower, and the time of your Drawing. Be true; stand; come to me.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The fear didn’t pass, but that terrible sense of impending panic did. He opened his eyes again and saw that he was not the only one who had sensed the power and awakening sentience of the place. Eddie was trying to pull away from the fence. He turned toward Jake, who could see Eddie’s eyes, wide and uneasy beneath his green head-band. His big brother grabbed him and pushed him toward the rusty gate, but the gesture was too half-hearted to be much of a tease; however thick-headed he might be, Henry liked The Mansion no better than Eddie did.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They drew away a little and stood looking at the place for a while. Jake could not make out what they were saying to each other, but the tone of their voices was awed and uneasy. Jake suddenly remembered Eddie speaking in his dream: <i class="calibre3">Remember there’s danger, though. Be careful . . . and be quick.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Suddenly the real Eddie, the one across the street, raised his voice enough so that Jake could make out the words. “Can we go home now, Henry? Please? I don’t like it.” His tone was pleading.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fuckin little sissy,” Henry said, but Jake thought he heard relief as well as indulgence in Henry’s voice. “Come on.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They turned away from the ruined house crouching high-shouldered behind its sagging fence and approached the street. Jake backed up, then turned and looked into the window of the dispirited little hole-in-the-wall shop called Dutch Hill Used Appliances. He watched Henry and Eddie, dim and ghostly reflections superimposed on an ancient Hoover vacuum cleaner, cross Rhinehold Street.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you <i class="calibre3">sure</i> it’s not really haunted?” Eddie asked as they stepped onto the sidewalk on Jake’s side.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, I tell you what,” Henry said. “Now that I been out here again, I’m really not so sure.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They passed directly behind Jake without looking at him. “Would you go in there?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not for a million dollars,” Henry replied promptly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They rounded the corner. Jake stepped away from the window and peeped after them. They were headed back the way they had come, close together on the sidewalk, Henry hulking along in his steel-toed shit-kickers, his shoulders already slumped like those of a much older man, Eddie walking beside him with neat, unconscious grace. Their shadows, long and trailing out into the street now, mingled amicably together.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">They’re going home</i>, Jake thought, and felt a wave of loneliness so strong that he felt it would crush him. <i class="calibre3">Going to eat supper and do homework and argue over which TV shows to watch and then go to bed. Henry may be a bullying shit, but they’ve got a life, those two, one that makes sense . . . and they’re going back to it. I wonder if they have any idea of how lucky they are. Eddie might, I suppose</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned, adjusted the straps of his pack, and crossed Rhinehold Street.

  <div class="tx">
    SUSANNAH SENSED MOVEMENT IN the empty grassland beyond the circle of standing stones: a sighing, whispering rush.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Something comin,” she said tautly. “Comin fast.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Be careful,” Eddie said, “but keep it off me. You understand? Keep it off me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I hear you, Eddie. You just do your own thing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie nodded. He knelt in the center of the ring, holding the sharpened stick out in front of him as if assessing its point. Then he lowered it and drew a dark straight line in the dirt. “Roland, watch out for her...”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I will if I can, Eddie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “. . . but keep it off me. Jake’s coming. Crazy little mother’s really coming.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah could now see the grasses due north of the speaking ring parting in a long dark line, creating a furrow that lanced straight at the circle of stones.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Get ready,” Roland said. “It’ll go for Eddie. One of us will have to ambush it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah reared up on her haunches like a snake coming out of a Hindu fakir’s basket. Her hands, rolled into hard brown fists, were held at the sides of her face. Her eyes blazed. “I’m ready,” she said and then shouted: <i class="calibre3">“Come on, big boy! You come on right now! Run like it’s yo birfday!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The rain began to fall harder as the demon which lived here re-entered its circle in a booming rush. Susannah had just time to sense thick and merciless masculinity—it came to her as an eyewatering smell of gin and juniper—and then it shot toward the center of the circle: She closed her eyes and reached for it, not with her arms or her mind but with all the female force which lived at the core of her: <i class="calibre3">Hey, big boy! Where you goan? D’pussy be ovah heah!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It whirled. She felt its surprise . . . and then its raw hunger, as full and urgent as a pulsing artery. It leaped upon her like a rapist springing from the mouth of an alley.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah howled and rocked backward, cords standing out on her neck. The dress she wore first flattened against her breasts and belly, and then began to tear itself to shreds. She could hear a pointless, directionless panting, as if the air itself had decided to rut with her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Suze!” Eddie shouted, and began to get to his feet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“No!”</i> she screamed back. <i class="calibre3">“Do it! I got this sumbitch right where . . . right where I want him! Go on, Eddie! Bring the kid! Bring—”</i> Coldness battered at the tender flesh between her legs. She grunted, fell backward . . then supported herself with one hand and thrust defiantly forward and upward. <i class="calibre3">“Bring him through!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked uncertainly at Roland, who nodded. Eddie glanced at Susannah again, his eyes full of dark pain and darker fear, and then deliberately turned his back on both of them and fell to his knees again. He reached forward with the sharpened stick which had become a makeshift pencil, ignoring the cold rain falling on his arms and the back of his neck. The stick began to move, making lines and angles, creating a shape Roland knew at once.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was a door.

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE REACHED OUT, PUT his hands on the splintery gate, and pushed. It swung slowly open on screaming, rust-clotted hinges. Ahead of him was an uneven brick path. Beyond the path was the porch. Beyond the porch was the door. It had been boarded shut.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He walked slowly toward the house, heart telegraphing fast dots and dashes in his throat. Weeds had grown up between the buckled bricks. He could hear them rustling against his blue jeans. All his senses seemed to have been turned up two notches. <i class="calibre3">You’re not really going in there, are you?</i> a panic-stricken voice in his head asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And the answer that occurred to him seemed both totally nuts and perfectly reasonable: <i class="calibre3">All things serve the Beam.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The sign on the lawn read

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="ctag">
        ABSOLUTELY <i class="calibre3">NO TRESPASSING</i> UNDER PENALTY OF LAW!
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The yellowing, rust-stained square of paper nailed to one of the boards crisscrossing the front door was more succinct:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="ctag">
        BY ORDER OF NYC HOUSING AUTHORITY <i class="calibre3">THIS PROPERTY CONDEMNED</i>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake paused at the foot of the steps, looking up at the door. He had heard voices in the vacant lot and now he could hear them again . . . but this was a choir of the damned, a babble of insane threats and equally insane promises. Yet he thought it was all one voice. The voice of the house; the voice of some monstrous doorkeeper, roused from its long unpeaceful sleep.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought briefly of his father’s Ruger, even considered pulling it out of his pack, but what good would it do? Behind him, traffic passed back and forth on Rhinehold Street and a woman was yelling for her daughter to stop holding hands with that boy and bring in the wash, but here was another world, one ruled by some bleak being over whom guns could have no power.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Be true, Jake—stand.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay,” he said in a low, shaky voice. “Okay, I’ll try. But you better not drop me again.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Slowly, he began to mount the porch steps.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h27"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_26"><b class="calibre4">27</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE BOARDS WHICH BARRED the door were old and rotten, the nails rusty. Jake grabbed hold of the top set at the point where they crossed each other and yanked. They came free with a squall that was the gate all over again. He tossed them over the porch rail and into an ancient flowerbed where only witch-grass and dogweed grew. He bent, grasped the lower crossing . . . and paused for a moment.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A hollow sound came through the door; the sound of some animal slobbering hungrily from deep inside a concrete pipe. Jake felt a sick sheen of sweat begin to break out on his cheeks and forehead. He was so frightened that he no longer felt precisely real; he seemed to have become a character in someone else’s bad dream.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The evil choir, the evil presence, was behind this door. The sound of it seeped out like syrup.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He yanked at the lower boards. They came free easily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Of course. It wants me to come in. It’s hungry, and I’m supposed to be the main course.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A snatch of poetry occurred to him suddenly, something Ms. Avery had read to them. It was supposed to be about the plight of modern man, who was cut off from all his roots and traditions, but to Jake it suddenly seemed that the man who had written that poem must have seen this house: <i class="calibre3">I will show you something different from either/Your shadow in the morning striding behind you/Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;/I will show you . . .</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll show you fear in a handful of dust,” Jake muttered, and put his hand on the doorknob. And as he did, that clear sense of relief and surety flooded him again, the feeling that this was it, this time the door would open on that other world, he would see a sky untouched by smog and industrial smoke, and, on the far horizon, not the mountains but the hazy blue spires of some gorgeous unknown city.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He closed his fingers around the silver key in his pocket, hoping the door was locked so he could use it. It wasn’t. The hinges screamed and flakes of rust sifted down from their slowly revolving cylinders as the door opened. The smell of decay struck Jake like a physical blow: wet wood, spongy plaster, rotting laths, ancient stuffing. Below these smells was another—the smell of some beast’s lair. Ahead was a dank, shadowy hallway. To the left, a staircase pitched and yawed its crazy way into the upper shadows. Its collapsed bannister lay splintered on the hallway floor, but Jake was not foolish enough to think it was <i class="calibre3">just</i> splinters he was looking at. There were bones in that litter, as well—the bones of small animals. Some did not look precisely like animal bones, and these Jake would not look at overlong; he knew he would never summon the courage to go further if he did. He paused on the threshold, screwing himself up to take the first step. He heard a faint, muffled sound, very hard and very rapid, and realized it was his own teeth chattering in his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Why doesn’t someone stop me?</i> he thought wildly. <i class="calibre3">Why doesn’t somebody passing on the sidewalk shout “Hey, you! You’re not supposed to be in there—can’t-cha read?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But he knew why. Pedestrians stuck mostly to the other side of this street, and those who came near this house did not linger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Even if someone did happen to look, they wouldn’t see me, because I’m not really here. For better or worse, I’ve already left my world behind. I’ve started to cross over. His world is somewhere ahead. This . . .</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This was the hell between.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake stepped into the corridor, and although he screamed when the door swung shut behind him with the sound of a mausoleum door being slammed, he wasn’t surprised.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Down deep, he wasn’t surprised at all.

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_27"><b class="calibre4">28</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    ONCE UPON A TIME there had been a young woman named Detta Walker who liked to frequent the honkytonks and roadhouses along Ridgeline Road outside of Nutley and on Route 88 down by the power-lines, outside of Amhigh. She had had legs in those days, and, as the song says, she knew how to use them. She would wear some tight cheap dress that looked like silk but wasn’t and dance with the white boys while the band played all those ofay party tunes like “Double Shot of My Baby’s Love” and “The Hippy-Hippy Shake.” Eventually she would cut one of the honkeys out of the pack and let him lead her back to his car in the parking lot. There she would make out with him (one of the world’s great soul-kissers was Detta Walker, and no slouch with the old fingernails, either) until he was just about insane . . . and then she’d shut him down. What happened next? Well, that was the question, wasn’t it? That was the game. Some of them wept and begged—all right, but not great. Some of them raved and roared, which was better.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And although she had been slapped upside the head, punched in the eye, spat upon, and once kicked in the ass so hard she had gone sprawling in the gravel parking lot of The Red Windmill, she had never been raped. They had all gone home with the blue balls, every damned ofay one of them. Which meant, in Detta Walker’s book, that she was the reigning champion, the undefeated queen. Of what? Of <i class="calibre3">them.</i> Of all those crewcut, button-down, tightass honkey motherfuckers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Until now.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no way to withstand the demon who lived in the speaking ring. No doorhandles to grab, no car to tumble out of, no building to run back into, no cheek to slap, no face to claw, no balls to kick if the ofay sumbitch was slow getting the message.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The demon was on her . . . and then, in a flash, it—<i class="calibre3">he</i>—was in her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She could feel it—<i class="calibre3">him</i>—pressing her backward, even though she could not see it—<i class="calibre3">him.</i> She could not see its—<i class="calibre3">his</i>—hands, but she could see their work as her dress tore violently open in several places. Then, suddenly, pain. It felt as though she were being ripped open down there, and in her agony and surprise she screamed. Eddie looked around, his eyes narrowing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m all right!” she yelled. “Go on, Eddie, forget about me! I’m all right!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But she wasn’t. For the first time since Detta had strode onto the sexual battlefield at the age of thirteen, she was losing. A horrid, engorged coldness plunged into her; it was like being fucked with an icicle.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Dimly, she saw Eddie turn away and begin drawing in the dirt again, his expression of warm concern fading back into the terrible, concentrated coldness she sometimes felt in him and saw on his face. Well, that was all right, wasn’t it? She had told him to go on, to forget her, to do what he needed to do in order to bring the boy over. This was her part of Jake’s drawing and she had no right to hate either of the men, who had not twisted her arm—or anything else—to make her do it, but as the coldness froze her and Eddie turned away from her, she hated them both; could, in fact, have torn their honkey balls off.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then Roland was with her, his strong hands were on her shoulders and although he didn’t speak, she heard him: <i class="calibre3">Don’t fight. You can’t win if you fight—you can only die. Sex is its weapon, Susannah, but it’s also its weakness.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yes. It was <i class="calibre3">always</i> their weakness. The only difference was that this time she was going to have to give a little more—but maybe that was all right. Maybe in the end, she would be able to make this invisible honkey demon <i class="calibre3">pay</i> a little more.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She forced herself to relax her thighs. Immediately they spread apart, pushing long, curved fans in the dirt. She threw her head back into the rain which was now pelting down and sensed its face lolling just over hers, eager eyes drinking in every contorted grimace which passed over her face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She reached up with one hand, as if to slap . . . and instead, slid it around the nape of her demon rapist’s neck. It was like cupping a palmful of solid smoke. And did she feel it twitch backward, surprised at her caress? She tilted her pelvis upward, using her grip on the invisible neck to create the leverage. At the same time she spread her legs even wider, splitting what remained of her dress up the side-seams. God, it was huge!
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on,” she panted. “You ain’t gonna rape me. You <i class="calibre3">ain’t.</i> You want t’fuck me? <i class="calibre3">I</i> fuck <i class="calibre3">you</i>. I give you a fuckin like you ain’t <i class="calibre3">nevah</i> had! Fuck you to <i class="calibre3">death!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She felt the engorgement within her tremble; felt the demon try, at least momentarily, to draw back and regroup.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Unh-unh, honey,” she croaked. She squeezed her thighs inward, pinning it. “De fun jus’ <i class="calibre3">startin.”</i> She began to flex her butt, humping at the invisible presence. She reached up with her free hand, interlaced all ten fingers, and allowed herself to fall backward with her hips cocked, her straining arms seeming to hold nothing. She tossed her sweat-damp hair out of her eyes; her lips split in a sharklike grin.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Let me go!</i> a voice cried out in her mind. But at the same time she could feel the owner of the voice responding in spite of itself.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No way, sugar. You wanted it . . . now you goan get it.” She thrust upward, holding on, concentrating fiercely on the freezing cold inside her. “I’m goan melt that icicle, sugar, and when it’s gone, what you goan do then?” Her lips rose and fell, rose and fell. She squeezed her thighs mercilessly together, closed her eyes, clawed more deeply into the unseen neck, and prayed that Eddie would be quick.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She didn’t know how long she could do this.

  <div class="tx">
    THE PROBLEM, JAKE THOUGHT, was simple: somewhere in this dank, terrible place was a locked door. The <i class="calibre3">right</i> door. All he had to do was find it. But it was hard, because he could feel the presence in the house gathering. The sound of those dissonant, gabbling voices was beginning to merge into one sound—a low, grating whisper.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And it was approaching.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A door stood open to the right. Beside it, thumb-tacked to the wall, was a faded daguerreotype which showed a hanged man dangling like a piece of rotten fruit from a dead tree. Beyond it was a room that had once been a kitchen. The stove was gone, but an ancient icebox—the kind with the circular refrigeration drum on top—stood on the far side of the hilly, faded linoleum: Its door gaped open. Black, smelly stuff was caked inside and had trickled down to form a long-congealed puddle on the floor. The kitchen cabinets stood open. In one he saw what was probably the world’s oldest can of Snow’s Clam Fry-Ettes. Poking out of another was the head of a dead rat. Its eyes were white and seemingly in motion, and after a moment Jake realized that the empty sockets were filled with squirming maggots.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Something fell into his hair with a flabby thump. Jake screamed in surprise, reached for it, and grasped something that felt like a soft, bristle-covered rubber ball. He pulled it free and saw it was a spider, its bloated body the color of a fresh bruise. Its eyes regarded him with stupid malevolence. Jake threw it against the wall. It broke open and splattered there, legs twitching feebly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Another one dropped onto his neck. Jake felt a sudden painful bite just below the place where his hair stopped. He ran backward into the hall, tripped over the fallen bannister, fell heavily, and felt the spider pop. Its innards—wet, feverish, and slippery—slid between his shoulder-blades like warm egg-yolk. Now he could see other spiders in the kitchen doorway. Some hung on almost invisible silken threads like obscene plumb-bobs; others simply dropped on the floor in a series of muddy plops and scuttered eagerly over to greet him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake flailed to his feet, still screaming. He felt something in his mind, something that felt like a frayed rope, starting to give way. He supposed it was his sanity, and at that realization, Jake’s considerable courage finally broke. He could bear this no longer, no matter what the stake. He bolted, meaning to flee if he still could, and realized too late that he had turned the wrong way and was running deeper into The Mansion instead of back toward the porch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He lunged into a space too big to be a parlor or living room; it seemed to be a ballroom. Elves with strange, sly smiles on their faces capered on the wallpaper, peering at Jake from beneath peaked green caps. A mouldy couch was pushed against one wall. In the center of the warped wooden floor was a splintered chandelier, its rusty chain lying in snarls among the spilled glass beads and dusty teardrop pendants. Jake skirted the wreck, snatching one terrified glance back over his shoulder. He saw no spiders; if not for the nastiness still trickling down his back, he might have believed he had imagined them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked forward again and came to a sudden, skidding halt. Ahead, a pair of french doors stood half-open on their recessed tracks. Another hallway stretched beyond. At the end of this second corridor stood a closed door with a golden knob. Written across the door—or perhaps carved into it—were two words:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="ctag">
        THE BOY

  <div class="tx1">
    Below the doorknob was a filigreed silver plate and a keyhole.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I found it! Jake thought fiercely. I finally found it! That’s it! That’s the door!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    From behind him a low groaning noise began, as if the house was beginning to tear itself apart. Jake turned and looked back across the ballroom. The wall on the far side of the room had begun to swell outward, pushing the ancient couch ahead of it. The old wallpaper shuddered; the elves began to ripple and dance. In places the paper simply snapped upward in long curls, like windowshades which have been released too suddenly. The plaster bulged forward in a pregnant curve. From beneath it, Jake could hear dry snapping sounds as the lathing broke, rearranging itself into some new, as-yet-hidden shape. And still the sound increased. Only it was no longer precisely a groan; now it sounded like a snarl.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stared, hypnotized, unable to pull his eyes away.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The plaster didn’t crack and then vomit outward in chunks; it seemed to have become plastic, and as the wall continued to bulge, making an irregular white bubble-shape from which scraps and draggles of wallpaper still hung, the surface began to mold itself into hills and curves and valleys. Suddenly Jake realized he was looking at a huge plastic face that was pushing itself out of the wall. It was like looking at someone who has walked headfirst into a wet sheet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a loud snap as a chunk of broken lath tore free of the rippling wall. It became the jagged pupil of one eye. Below it, the wall writhed into a snarling mouth filled with jagged teeth. Jake could see fragments of wallpaper clinging to its lips and gums.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One plaster hand tore free of the wall, trailing an unravelling bracelet of rotted electrical wire. It grasped the sofa and threw it aside, leaving ghostly white fingermarks on its dark surface. More lathing burst free as the plaster fingers flexed. They created sharp, splintery claws. Now the face was all the way out of the wall and staring at Jake with its one wooden eye. Above it, in the center of its forehead, one wallpaper elf still danced. It looked like a weird tattoo. There was a wrenching sound as the thing began to slide forward. The hall doorway tore out and became a hunched shoulder. The thing’s one free hand clawed across the floor, spraying glass droplets from the fallen chandelier.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s paralysis broke. He turned, lunged through the french doors, and pelted down the second length of hallway with his pack bouncing and his right hand groping for the key in his pocket. His heart was a runaway factory machine in his chest. Behind him, the thing which was crawling out of The Mansion’s woodwork bellowed at him, and although there were no words, Jake knew what it was saying; it was telling him to stand still, telling him that it was useless to run, telling him there was no escape. The whole house now seemed alive; the air resounded with splintering wood and squalling beams. The humming, insane voice of the doorkeeper was everywhere.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s hand closed on the key. As he brought it out, one of the notches caught in the pocket. His fingers, wet with sweat, slipped. The key fell to the floor, bounced, dropped through a crack between two warped boards, and disappeared.

    “HE’S IN TROUBLE!” SUSANNAH heard Eddie shout, but the sound of his voice was distant. She had plenty of trouble herself . . . but she thought she might be doing okay, just the same.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I’m goan melt that icicle, sugar</i>, she had told the demon. <i class="calibre3">I’m goan melt it, and when it’s gone, what you goan do then?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She hadn’t melted it, exactly, but she had <i class="calibre3">changed</i> it. The thing inside her was certainly giving her no pleasure, but at least the terrible pain had subsided and it was no longer cold. It was trapped, unable to disengage. Nor was she holding it in with her body, exactly. Roland had said sex was its weakness as well as its weapon, and he had been right, as usual. It had taken her, but <i class="calibre3">she</i> had also taken <i class="calibre3">it</i>, and now it was as if each of them had a finger stuck in one of those fiendish Chinese tubes, where yanking only sticks you tighter.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She hung onto one idea for dear life; <i class="calibre3">had</i> to, because all other conscious thought had vanished. She had to hold this sobbing, frightened, vicious thing in the snare of its own helpless lust. It wriggled and thrust and convulsed within her, screaming to be let go at the same time it used her body with greedy, helpless intensity, but she would not let it go free.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">And what’s gonna happen when I finally do let go?</i> she <i class="calibre3">wondered desperately. What’s it gonna do to pay me back?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She didn’t know.

  <div class="tx">
    THE RAIN WAS FALLING in sheets, threatening to turn the circle within the stones into a sea of mud. <i class="calibre3">“Hold something over the door!”</i> Eddie shouted. <i class="calibre3">“Don’t let the rain wash it out!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland snatched a glance at Susannah and saw she was still struggling with the demon. Her eyes were half-shut, her mouth pulled down in a harsh grimace. He could not see or hear the demon, but he could sense its angry, frightened thrashings.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie turned his streaming face toward him. “<i class="calibre3">Did you hear me?”</i> he shouted. <i class="calibre3">“Get something over the goddam door, and do it NOW!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland yanked one of their hides from his pack and held a corner in each hand. Then he stretched his arms out and leaned over Eddie, creating a makeshift tent. The tip of Eddie’s homemade pencil was caked with mud. He wiped it across his arm, leaving a smear the color of bitter chocolate, then wrapped his fist around the stick again and bent over his drawing. It was not exactly the same size as the door on Jake’s side of the barrier—the ratio was perhaps .75:1—but it would be big enough for Jake to come through . . . if the keys worked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">If he even has a key, isn’t that what you mean? he asked himself. Suppose he’s dropped it . . . or that house made him drop it?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He drew a plate under the circle which represented the doorknob, hesitated, and then squiggled the familiar shape of a keyhole within it:

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="013" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00013.gif"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He hesitated. There was one more thing, but what? It was hard to think of, because it felt as if there were a tornado roaring through his head, a tornado with random thoughts flipping around inside it instead of uprooted barns and privies and chicken-houses.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, sugah!” Susannah cried from behind him. “You weakenin on me! Wassa matta? I thought you was some kind of hot-shit studboy!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Boy.</i> That was it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Carefully, he wrote THE BOY across the top panel of the door with the tip of his stick. At the instant he finished the Y, the drawing changed. The circle of rain-darkened earth he had drawn suddenly darkened even more . . . and pushed up from the ground, becoming a dark, gleaming knob. And instead of brown, wet earth within the shape of the keyhole, he could see dim light.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Behind him, Susannah shrieked at the demon again, urging it on, but now she sounded as if she were tiring. This had to end, and soon.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie bent forward from the waist like a Muslim saluting Allah, and put his eye to the keyhole he had drawn. He looked through it into his own world, into that house which he and Henry had gone to see in May of 1977, unaware (except he, Eddie, had not been unaware; no, not totally unaware, even then) that a boy from another part of the city was following them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He saw a hallway. Jake was down on his hands and knees, tugging frantically at a board. Something was coming for him. Eddie could see it, but at the same time he could not—it was as if part of his brain <i class="calibre3">refused</i> to see it, as if seeing would lead to comprehension and comprehension to madness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Hurry up, Jake!”</i> he screamed into the keyhole. <i class="calibre3">“For Christ’s sake, move it!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Above the speaking ring, thunder ripped the sky like cannon-fire and the rain turned to hail.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_31"><b class="calibre4">32</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    FOR A MOMENT AFTER the key fell, Jake only stood where he was, staring down at the narrow crack between the boards.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Incredibly, he felt sleepy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That shouldn’t have happened, he thought. It’s one thing too much. I can’t go on with this, not one minute, not one single second longer. I’m going to curl up against that door instead. I’m going to go to sleep, right away, all at once, and when it grabs me and pulls me toward its mouth, I’ll never wake up.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the thing coming out of the wall grunted, and when Jake looked up, his urge to give in vanished in a single stroke of terror. Now it was all the way out of the wall, a giant plaster head with one broken wooden eye and one reaching plaster hand. Chunks of lathing stood out on its skull in random hackles, like a child’s drawing of hair. It saw Jake and opened its mouth, revealing jagged wooden teeth. It grunted again. Plaster-dust drifted out of its yawning mouth like cigar smoke.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake fell to his knees and peered into the crack. The key was a small brave shimmer of silvery light down there in the dark, but the crack was far too narrow to admit his fingers. He seized one of the boards and yanked with all his might. The nails which held it groaned . . . but held.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a jangling crash. He looked down the hallway and saw the hand, which was bigger than his whole body, seize the fallen chandelier and throw it aside. The rusty chain which had once held it suspended rose like a bullwhip and then came down with a heavy crump. A dead lamp on a rusty chain rattled above Jake, dirty glass chattering against ancient brass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The doorkeeper’s head, attached only to its single hunched shoulder and reaching arm, slid forward above the floor. Behind it, the remains of the wall collapsed in a cloud of dust. A moment later the fragments humped up and became the creature’s twisted, bony back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The doorkeeper saw Jake looking and seemed to grin. As it did, splinters of wood poked out of its wrinkling cheeks. It dragged itself forward through the dust-hazed ballroom, mouth opening and closing. Its great hand groped amid the ruins, feeling for purchase, and ripped one of the french doors at the end of the hall from its track.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake screamed breathlessly and began to wrench at the board again. It wouldn’t come, but the gunslinger’s voice did:
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“The other one, Jake! Try the other one!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He let go of the board he had been yanking at and grabbed the one on the other side of the crack. As he did, another voice spoke. He heard this one not in his head but with his ears, and understood it was coming from the other side of the door—the door he had been looking for ever since the day he hadn’t been run over in the street.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Hurry up, Jake! For Christ’s sake, hurry up!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When he yanked this other board, it came free so easily that he almost tumbled over backward.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    Two WOMEN WERE STANDING in the doorway of the used appliance shop across the street from The Mansion. The older was the proprietor; the younger had been her only customer when the sounds of crashing walls and breaking beams began. Now, without knowing they were doing it, they linked arms about each other’s waists and stood that way, trembling like children who hear a noise in the dark.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Up the street, a trio of boys on their way to the Dutch Hill Little League field stood gaping at the house, their Red Ball Flyer wagon filled with baseball equipment forgotten behind them. A delivery driver nosed his van into the curb and got out to look. The patrons of Henry’s Corner Market and the Dutch Hill Pub came straggling up the street, looking around wildly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now the ground began to tremble, and a fan of fine cracks started to spread across Rhinehold Street.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is it an earthquake?” the delivery van driver shouted at the women standing outside the appliance shop, but instead of waiting for an answer he jumped back behind the wheel of his van and drove away rapidly, swerving to the wrong side of the street to keep away from the ruined house which was the epicenter of this convulsion.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The entire house seemed to be bowing inward. Boards splintered, jumped off its face, and rained down into the yard. Dirty gray-black waterfalls of slate shingles poured down from the eaves. There was an earsplitting bang and a long, zigzagging crack shot down the center of The Mansion. The door disappeared into it and then the whole house began to swallow itself from the outside in.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The younger woman suddenly broke the older one’s grip. “I’m getting out of here,” she said, and began to run up the street without looking back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    A HOT, STRANGE WIND began to sigh down the hallway, blowing Jake’s sweaty hair back from his brow as his fingers closed over the silver key. He now understood on some instinctive level what this place was, and what was happening. The doorkeeper was not just <i class="calibre3">in</i> the house, it <i class="calibre3">was</i> the house: every board, every shingle, every windowsill, every eave. And now it was pushing forward, becoming some crazily jumbled representation of its true shape as it did. It meant to catch him before he could use the key. Beyond the giant white head and the crooked, hulking shoulder, he could see boards and shingles and wire and bits of glass—even the front door and the broken bannister—flying up the main hall and into the ballroom, joining the form which bulked there, creating more and more of the misshapen plaster-man that was even now groping toward him with its freakish hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake yanked his own hand out of the hole in the floor and saw it was covered with huge trundling beetles. He slapped it against the wall to knock them off, and cried out as the wall first opened and then tried to close around his wrist. He yanked his hand free just in time, whirled, and jammed the silver key into the hole in the plate.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The plaster-man roared again, but its voice was momentarily drowned out by a harmonic shout which Jake recognized: he had heard it in the vacant lot, but it had been quiet then, perhaps dreaming. Now it was an unequivocal cry of triumph. That sense of certainty—overwhelming, inarguable—filled him again, and this time he felt sure there would be no disappointment. He heard all the affirmation he needed in that voice. It was the voice of the rose.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The dim light in the hallway was blotted out as the plaster hand tore away the other french door and squeezed into the corridor. The face socked itself into the opening above the hand, peering at Jake. The plaster fingers crawled toward him like the legs of a huge spider.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned the key and felt a sudden surge of power rush up his arm. He heard a heavy, muffled thump as the locked bolt inside withdrew. He seized the knob, turned it, and yanked the door open. It swung wide. Jake cried out in confused horror as he saw what lay behind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The doorway was blocked with earth, from top to bottom and side to side. Roots poked out like bunches of wire. Worms, seeming as confused as Jake was himself, crawled hither and thither on the door-shaped pack of dirt. Some dived back into it; others only went on crawling about, as if wondering where the earth which had been below them a moment ago had gone. One dropped onto Jake’s sneaker.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The keyhole shape remained for a moment, shedding a spot of misty white light on Jake’s shirt. Beyond it—so close, so out of reach—he could hear rain and a muffled boom of thunder across an open sky. Then the keyhole shape was also blotted out, and gigantic plaster fingers curled around Jake’s lower leg.

    EDDIE DID NOT FEEL the sting of the hail as Roland dropped the hide, got to his feet, and ran to where Susannah lay.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger grabbed her beneath the arms and dragged her—as gently and carefully as he could—across to where Eddie crouched. “Let it go when I tell you, Susannah!” Roland shouted. “Do you understand? <i class="calibre3">When I tell you!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie saw and heard none of this. He heard only Jake, screaming faintly on the other side of the door.

  <div class="tx1">
    The time had come to use the key.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pulled it out of his shirt and slid it into the keyhole he had drawn. He tried to turn it. The key would not turn. Not so much as a milllimeter. Eddie lifted his face to the pelting hail, oblivious to the iceballs which struck his forehead and cheeks and lips, leaving welts and red blotches.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“NO!”</i> he howled. “<i class="calibre3">OH</i> <i class="calibre3">GOD, PLEASE!</i> <i class="calibre3">NO!”</i>

    JAKE LUNGED UPWARD, GRABBED the chain of the lamp which hung above him, and ripped free of the doorkeeper’s clutching fingers. He swung backward, used the packed earth in the doorway to push off, and then swung forward again like Tarzan on a vine. He raised his legs and kicked out at the clutching fingers as he closed on them. Plaster exploded in chunks, revealing a crudely jointed skeleton of lathing beneath. The plaster-man roared, a sound of intermingled hunger and rage. Beneath that cry, Jake could hear the whole house collapsing, like the one in that story of Edgar Allan Poe.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pendulumed back on the chain, struck the wall of packed earth which blocked the doorway, then swung forward again. The hand reached up for him and he kicked at it wildly, legs scissoring. He felt a stab of pain in his foot as those wooden fingers clutched. When he swung back again, he was minus a sneaker.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He tried for a higher grip on the chain, found it, and began to shinny up toward the ceiling. There was a muffled, creaking thud above him. Fine plaster dust had begun to sift down on his upturned, sweating face. The ceiling had begun to sag; the lamp-chain was pulling out of it a link at a time. There was a thick crunching sound from the end of the hallway as the plaster-man finally pushed its hungry face through the opening.
  </div>

    Jake swung helplessly back toward that face, screaming.

    EDDIE’S TERROR AND PANIC suddenly fell away. The cloak of coldness dropped over him—a cloak Roland of Gilead had worn many times. It was the only armor the true gunslinger possessed . . . and all such a one needed. At the same moment, a voice spoke in his mind. He had been haunted by such voices over the last three months; his mother’s voice, Roland’s voice, and, of course, Henry’s. But this one, he recognized with relief, was his own, and it was at last calm and rational and courageous.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You saw the shape of the key in the fire, you saw it again in the wood, and both times you saw it perfectly. Later on, you put a blindfold of fear over your eyes. Take it off. Take it off and look again. It may not be too late, even now.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was faintly aware that the gunslinger was staring at him grimly; faintly aware that Susannah was shrieking at the demon in a fading but still defiant voice; faintly aware that, on the other side of the door, Jake was screaming in terror—or was it now agony?
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <br class="calibre2"/>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie ignored them all. He pulled the wooden key out of the keyhole he had drawn, out of the door which was now real, and looked at it fixedly, trying to recapture the innocent delight he had sometimes known as a child—the delight of seeing a coherent shape hidden in senselessness. And there it was, the place he’d gone wrong, so clearly visible he couldn’t understand how he’d missed it in the first place. <i class="calibre3">I really must have been wearing a blindfold,</i> he thought. It was the s-shape at the end of the key, of course. The second curve was a bit too fat. Just a tiny bit.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Knife,” he said, and held out his hand like a surgeon in an operating room. Roland slapped it into his palm without a word.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie gripped the top of the blade between the thumb and first finger of his right hand. He bent over the key, unmindful of the hail which pelted his unprotected neck, and the shape in the wood stood out more clearly—stood out with its own lovely and undeniable reality.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He scraped.

  <div class="tx1">
    Once.

  <div class="tx1">
    Delicately.

  <div class="tx1">
    A single sliver of ash, so thin it was almost transparent, curled up from the belly of the s-shape at the end of the key.

    THE CHAIN LET GO with a rattling crash and Jake fell heavily, landing on his knees. The doorkeeper roared in triumph. The plaster hand seized Jake about his hips and began to drag him down the hall. He stuck his legs out in front of him and planted his feet, but it did no good. He felt splinters and rust-blunted nails digging into his skin as the hand tightened its grip and continued to drag him forward.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The face appeared to be stuck just inside the entrance to the hallway like a cork in a bottle. The pressure it had exerted to get in that far had squeezed the rudimentary features into a new shape, that of some monstrous, malformed troll. The mouth yawned open to receive him. Jake groped madly for the key, wanting to use it as some last-ditch talisman, but of course he had left it in the door.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“You son of a bitch!”</i> he screamed, and threw himself backward with all his strength, bowing his back like an Olympic diver, unmindful of the broken boards which dug into him like a belt of nails. He felt his jeans slide down on his hips, and the grip of the hand slipped momentarily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake lunged again. The hand clenched brutally, but Jake’s jeans slid down to his knees and his back slammed to the floor, with the pack to cushion the blow. The hand loosened, perhaps wanting to secure a firmer grip upon its prey. Jake was able to draw his knees up a little, and when the hand tightened again, Jake drove his legs forward. The hand yanked backward at the same time, and what Jake had hoped for happened: his jeans (and his remaining sneaker) were peeled from his body, leaving him free again, at least for the moment. He saw the hand rotate on his wrist of boards and disintegrating plaster and jam his dungarees into his mouth. Then he was crawling back toward the blocked doorway on his hands and knees, oblivious of the glass fragments from the fallen lamp, wanting only to get his key again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had almost reached the door when the hand closed over his naked legs and began to pull him back once more.

    THE SHAPE WAS THERE now, finally all there.

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie put the key back into the keyhole and applied pressure. For a moment there was resistance . . . and then it revolved beneath his hand. He heard the locking mechanism turn, heard the bar pull back, felt the key crack in two the moment it had served its purpose. He grasped the dark, polished knob with both hands and pulled. There was a sense of great weight wheeling on an unseen pivot. A feeling that his arm had been gifted with boundless strength. And a clear knowledge that two worlds had suddenly come in contact, and a way had been opened between them.

    He felt a moment of dizziness and disorientation, and as he looked through the doorway he realized why: although he was looking down—vertically—he was seeing <i class="calibre3">horizontally.</i> It was like a strange optical illusion created with prisms and mirrors. Then he saw Jake being pulled backward down the glass- and plaster-littered hallway, elbows dragging, calves pinned together by a giant hand. And he saw the monstrous mouth which awaited him, fuming some white fog that might have been either smoke or dust.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Roland!”</i> Eddie shouted. <i class="calibre3">“Roland, it’s got h—”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he was knocked aside.

  <div class="tx">
    SUSANNAH WAS AWARE OF being hauled up and whirled around. The world was a carousel blur: standing stones, gray sky, hailstone-littered ground . . . and a rectangular hole that looked like a trapdoor in the ground. Screams drifted up from it. Within her, the demon raved and struggled, wanting only to escape but helpless to do so until she allowed it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Now!”</i> Roland was shouting. <i class="calibre3">“Let it go now, Susannah! For your father’s sake, let it go NOW!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And she did.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She had (with Detta’s help) constructed a trap for it in her mind, something like a net of woven rushes, and now she cut them. She felt the demon fly back from her at once, and there was an instant of terrible hollowness, terrible emptiness. These feelings were at once overshadowed by relief and a grim sense of nastiness and defilement.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As its invisible weight fell away, she glimpsed it—an inhuman shape like a manta-ray with huge, curling wings and something that looked like a cruel baling hook curving out and up from beneath. She saw/ sensed the thing flash above the open hole in the ground. Saw Eddie looking up with wide eyes. Saw Roland spread his arms wide to catch the demon.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger staggered back, almost knocked off his feet by the unseen weight of the demon. Then he rocked forward again with an armload of nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Clutching it, he jumped through the doorway and was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_40"><b class="calibre4">41</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    SUDDEN WHITE LIGHT FLOODED the hallway of The Mansion; hailstones struck the walls and bounced up from the broken boards of the floor. Jake heard confused shouts, then saw the gunslinger come through. He seemed to <i class="calibre3">leap</i> through, as if he had come from above. His arms were held far out in front of him, the tips of the fingers locked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake felt his feet slide into the doorkeeper’s mouth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Roland!”</i> he shrieked. <i class="calibre3">“Roland, help me!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger’s hands parted and his arms were immediately thrown wide. He staggered backward. Jake felt serrated teeth touch his skin, ready to tear flesh and grind bone, and then something huge rushed over his head like a gust of wind. A moment later the teeth were gone. The hand which had pinned his legs together relaxed. He heard an unearthly shriek of pain and surprise begin to issue from the doorkeeper’s dusty throat, and then it was muffled, crammed back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland grabbed Jake and hauled him to his feet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You came!” Jake shouted. “You really came!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I came, yes. By the grace of the gods and the courage of my friends, I came.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As the doorkeeper roared again, Jake burst into tears of relief and terror. Now the house sounded like a ship foundering in a heavy sea. Chunks of wood and plaster fell all around them. Roland swept Jake into his arms and ran for the door. The plaster hand, groping wildly, struck one of his booted feet and spun him into the wall, which again tried to bite. Roland pushed forward, turned, and drew his gun. He fired twice into the aimlessly thrashing hand, vaporizing one of the crude plaster fingers. Behind them, the face of the doorkeeper had gone from white to a dingy purplish-black, as if it were choking on something—something which had been fleeing so rapidly that it had entered the monster’s mouth and jammed in its gullet before it realized what it was doing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland turned again and ran through the doorway. Although there was now no visible barrier, he was stopped cold for a moment, as if an unseen meshwork had been drawn across the chair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he felt Eddie’s hands in his hair and he was yanked not forward but upward.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h42"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_41"><b class="calibre4">42</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THEY EMERGED INTO WET air and slackening hail like babies being born. Eddie was the midwife, as the gunslinger had told him he must be. He was sprawled forward on his chest and belly, his arms out of sight in the doorway, his hands clutching fistfuls of Roland’s hair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Suze! Help me!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She wriggled forward, reached through; and groped a hand under Roland’s chin. He came up to her with his head cocked backward and his lips parted in a snarl of pain and effort.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie felt a tearing sensation and one of his hands came free holding a thick lock of the gunslinger’s gray-streaked hair. “He’s slipping!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This motherfucker . . . ain’t . . . <i class="calibre3">nowhere!”</i> Susannah gasped, and gave a terrific wrench, as if she meant to snap Roland’s neck.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Two small hands shot out of the doorway in the center of the circle and clutched one of the edges. Freed of Jake’s weight, Roland got an elbow up, and a moment later he was boosting himself out. As he did it, Eddie grabbed Jake’s wrists and hauled him up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake rolled onto his back and lay there, panting.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie turned to Susannah, took her in his arms, and began to rain kisses on her forehead, cheeks, and neck. He was laughing and crying at the same time. She clung to him, breathing hard . . . but there was a small, satisfied smile on her lips and one hand slipped over Eddie’s wet hair in slow, contented strokes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    From below them came a cauldron of black sounds: squeals, grunts, thuds, crashes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland crawled away from the hole with his head down. His hair stood up in a wild wad. Threads of blood trickled down his cheeks. “Shut it!” he gasped at Eddie. “Shut it, for your father’s sake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie got the door moving, and those vast, unseen hinges did the rest. The door fell with a gigantic, toneless bang, cutting off all sound from below. As Eddie watched, the lines that had marked its edges faded back to smudged marks in the dirt. The doorknob lost its dimension and was once more only a circle he’d drawn with a stick. Where the keyhole had been there was only a crude shape with a chunk of wood sticking out of it, like the hilt of a sword from a stone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah went to Jake and pulled him gently to a sitting position. “You all right, sugar?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at her dazedly. “Yes, I think so. Where is he? The gunslinger? There’s something I have to ask him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m here, Jake,” Roland said. He got to his feet, drunk-walked over to Jake, and hunkered beside him. He touched the boy’s smooth cheek almost unbelievingly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You won’t let me drop this time?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” Roland said. “Not this time, not ever again.” But in the deepest darkness of his heart, he thought of the Tower and wondered.
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_42"><b class="calibre4">43</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE HAIL CHANGED TO a hard, driving rain, but Eddie could see gleams of blue sky behind the unravelling clouds in the north. The storm was going to end soon, but in the meantime, they were going to get drenched.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He found he didn’t mind. He could not remember when he had felt so calm, so at peace with himself, so utterly drained. This mad adventure wasn’t over yet—he suspected, in fact, that it had barely begun—but today they had won a big one.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Suze?” He pushed her hair away from her face and looked into her dark eyes. “Are you okay? Did it hurt you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hurt me a little, but I’m okay. I think that bitch Detta Walker is still the undefeated Roadhouse Champeen, demon or no demon.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s that mean?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She grinned impishly. “Not much, not anymore . . . thank God. How about you, Eddie? All right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie listened for Henry’s voice and didn’t hear it. He had an idea that Henry’s voice might be gone for good. “Even better than that,” he said, and, laughing, folded her into his arms again. Over her shoulder he could see what was left of the door: only a few faint lines and angles. Soon the rain would wash those away, too.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h44"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_43"><b class="calibre4">44</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “WHAT’S YOUR NAME?” JAKE asked the woman whose legs stopped just above the knee. He was suddenly aware that he had lost his pants in his struggle to escape the doorkeeper, and he pulled the tail of his shirt down over his underwear. There wasn’t very much left of her dress, either, as far as that went.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Susannah Dean,” she said. “I already know your name.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Susannah,” Jake said thoughtfully. “I don’t suppose your father owns a railroad company, does he?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She looked astonished for a moment, then threw her head back and laughed. “Why, no, sugar! He was a dentist who went and invented a few things and got rich. What makes you ask a thing like that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake didn’t answer. He had turned his attention to Eddie. The terror had already left his face, and his eyes had regained that cool, assessing look which Roland remembered so well from the way station.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hi, Jake,” Eddie said. “Good to see you, man.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hi,” Jake said. “I met you earlier today, but you were a lot younger then.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I was a lot younger ten minutes ago. Are you okay?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Jake said. “Some scratches, that’s all.” He looked around. “You haven’t found the train yet.” This was not a question.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie and Susannah exchanged puzzled looks, but Roland only shook his head. “No train.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are your voices gone?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “All gone. Yours?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Gone. I’m all together again. We both are.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They looked at the same instant, with the same impulse. As Roland swept Jake into his arms, the boy’s unnatural self-possession broke and he began to cry—it was the exhausted, relieved weeping of a child who has been lost long, suffered much, and is finally safe again. As Roland’s arms closed about his waist, Jake’s own arms slipped about the gunslinger’s neck and gripped like hoops of steel.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll never leave you again,” Roland said, and now his own tears came. “I swear to you on the names of all my fathers: <i class="calibre3">I’ll never leave you again.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yet his heart, that silent, watchful, lifelong prisoner of <i class="calibre3">ka,</i> received the words of this promise not just with wonder but with doubt.
