  <div class="tx">
    THEY CAME UPON THE downed airplane three days later.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake pointed it out first at midmorning—a flash of light about ten miles away, as if a mirror lay in the grass. As they drew closer, they saw a large dark object at the side of the Great Road.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It looks like a dead bird,” Roland said. “A big one.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s no bird,” Eddie said. “That’s an airplane. I’m pretty sure the glare is sunlight bouncing off the canopy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    An hour later they stood silently at the edge of the road, looking at the ancient wreck. Three plump crows stood on the tattered skin of the fuselage, staring insolently at the newcomers. Jake pried a cobble from the edge of the road and shied it at them. The crows lumbered into the air, cawing indignantly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One wing had broken off in the crash and lay thirty yards away, a shadow like a diving board in the tall grass. The rest of the plane was pretty much intact. The canopy had cracked in a starburst pattern where the pilot’s head had struck it. There was a large, rust-colored stain there.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy trotted over to where three rusty propeller blades rose from the grass, sniffed at them, then returned hastily to Jake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The man in the cockpit was a dust-dry mummy wearing a padded leather vest and a helmet with a spike on top. His lips were gone, his teeth exposed in a final desperate grimace. Fingers which had once been as large as sausages but were now only skin-covered bones clutched the wheel. His skull was caved in where it had hit the canopy, and Roland guessed that the greenish-gray scales which coated the left side of his face were all that remained of his brains. The dead man’s head was tilted back, as if he had been sure, even at the moment of his death, that he could regain the sky again. The plane’s remaining wing still jutted from the encroaching grass. On it was a fading insignia which depicted a fist holding a thunderbolt.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Looks like Aunt Talitha was wrong and the old albino man had the right of it, after all,” Susannah said in an awed voice. “That must be David Quick, the outlaw prince. Look at the size of him, Roland—they must have had to grease him to get him into the cockpit!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. The heat and the years had wasted the man in the mechanical bird to no more than a skeleton wrapped in dry hide, but he could still see how broad the shoulders had been, and the misshapen head was massive. “So fell Lord Perth,” he said, “and the countryside did shake with that thunder.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked at him questioningly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s from an old poem. Lord Perth was a giant who went forth to war with a thousand men, but he was still in his own country when a little boy threw a stone at him and hit him in the knee. He stumbled, the weight of his armor bore him down, and he broke his neck in the fall.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake said, “Like our story of David and Goliath.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There was no fire,” Eddie said. “I bet he just ran out of gas and tried a dead-stick landing on the road. He might have been an outlaw and a barbarian, but he had a yard of guts.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded, and looked at Jake. “You all right with this?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. If the guy was still, you know, runny, I might not be.” Jake looked from the dead man in the airplane to the city. Lud was much closer and clearer now, and although they could see many broken windows in the towers, he, like Eddie, had not entirely given up hope of finding some sort of help there. “I bet things sort of fell apart in the city once he was gone.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think you’d win that bet,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You know something?” Jake was studying the plane again. “The people who built that city might have made their own airplanes, but I’m pretty sure this is one of ours. I did a school paper on air combat when I was in the fifth grade, and I think I recognize it. Roland, can I take a closer look?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “I’ll go with you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Together they walked over to the plane with the high grass swishing at their pants. “Look,” Jake said. “See the machine-gun under the wing? That’s an air-cooled German model, and this is a Focke-Wulf from just before World War II. I’m sure it is. So what’s it doing here?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Lots of planes disappear,” Eddie said. “Take the Bermuda Triangle, for instance. That’s a place over one of our oceans, Roland. It’s supposed to be jinxed. Maybe it’s a great big doorway between our worlds one that’s almost always open.” Eddie hunched his shoulders and essayed a bad Rod Serling imitation. “Fasten your seatbelts and prepare for turbulence: you’re flying into . . . the Roland Zone!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake and Roland, who were now standing beneath the plane’s remaining wing, ignored him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Boost me up, Roland.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “That wing looks solid, but it’s not—this thing has been here a long time, Jake. You’d fall.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Make a step, then.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie said, “I’ll do it, Roland.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland studied his diminished right hand for a moment, shrugged, then laced his hands together. “This’ll do. He’s light.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake shook off his moccasin and then stepped lightly into the stirrup Roland had made. Oy began to bark shrilly, though whether in excitement or alarm, Roland couldn’t tell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s chest was now pressing against one of the airplane’s rusty flaps, and he was looking right at the fist-and-thunderbolt design. It had peeled up a little from the surface of the wing along one edge. He seized this flap and pulled. It came off the wing so easily that he would have fallen backward if Eddie, standing directly behind him, hadn’t steadied him with a hand on the butt.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I <i class="calibre3">knew</i> it,” Jake said. There was another symbol beneath the fist-and-thunderbolt, and now it was almost totally revealed. It was a swastika. “I just wanted to see it. You can put me down now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They started out again, but they could see the tail of the plane every time they looked back that afternoon, looming out of the high grass like Lord Perth’s burial monument<b class="calibre4">.</b>
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h2"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_1"><b class="calibre4">2</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    IT WAS JAKE’S TURN to make the fire that night. When the wood was laid to the gunslinger’s satisfaction, he handed Jake his flint and steel. “Let’s see how you do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie and Susannah were sitting off to one side, their arms linked companionably about each other’s waist. Toward the end of the day, Eddie had found a bright yellow flower beside the road and had picked it for her. Tonight Susannah was wearing it in her hair, and every time she looked at Eddie, her lips curved in a small smile and her eyes filled with light. Roland had noted these things, and they pleased him. Their love was deepening, strengthening. That was good. It would have to be deep and strong indeed if it was to survive the months and years ahead. Jake struck a spark, but it flashed inches away from the kindling.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Move your flint in closer,” Roland said, “and hold it steady. And don’t <i class="calibre3">hit</i> it with the steel, Jake; <i class="calibre3">scrape</i> it. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake tried again, and this time the spark flashed directly into the kindling. There was a little tendril of smoke but no fire.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t think I’m very good at this.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’ll get it. Meantime, think on this. What’s dressed when night falls and undressed when day breaks?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Huh?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland moved Jake’s hands even closer to the little pile of kindling. “I guess that one’s not in your book.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, it’s a riddle!” Jake struck another spark. This time a small flame glowed in the kindling before dying out. “You know some of those, too?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “Not just some—a lot. As a boy, I must have known a thousand. They were part of my studies.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Really? Why would anyone study riddles?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Vannay, my tutor, said a boy who could answer a riddle was a boy who could think around corners. We had riddling contests every Friday noon, and the boy or girl who won could leave school early.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Did you get to leave early often, Roland?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He shook his head, smiling a little himself. “I enjoyed riddling, but I was never very good at it. Vannay said it was because I thought too deeply. My father said it was because I had too little imagination. I think they were both right . . . but I think my father had a little more of the truth. I could always haul a gun faster than any of my mates, and shoot straighter, but I’ve never been much good at thinking around corners.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah, who had watched closely as Roland dealt with the old people of River Crossing, thought the gunslinger was underrating himself, but she said nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sometimes, on winter nights, there would be riddling competitions in the great hall. When it was just the younkers, Alain always won. When the grownups played as well, it was always Cort. He’d forgotten more riddles than the rest of us ever knew, and after the Fair-Day Riddling, Cort always carried home the goose. Riddles have great power, and everyone knows one or two.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Even me,” Eddie said. “For instance, why did the dead baby cross the road?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s dumb, Eddie,” Susannah said, but she was smiling.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because it was stapled to the chicken!” Eddie yelled, and grinned when Jake burst into laughter, knocking his little pile of kindling apart. “Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk, I got a million of em, folks!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland, however, didn’t laugh. He looked, in fact, a trifle offended. “Pardon me for saying so, Eddie, but that <i class="calibre3">is</i> rather silly.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jesus, Roland, I’m sorry,” Eddie said. He was still smiling, but he sounded slightly peeved. “I keep forgetting you got your sense of humor shot off in the Children’s Crusade, or whatever it was.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s just that I take riddling seriously. I was taught that the ability to solve them indicates a sane and rational mind.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, they’re never going to replace the works of Shakespeare or the Quadratic Equation,” Eddie said. “I mean, let’s not get carried away.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake was looking at Roland thoughtfully. “My book said riddling is the oldest game people still play. In our world, I mean. And riddles used to be really serious business, not just jokes. People used to get killed over them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland was looking out into the growing darkness. “Yes. I’ve seen it happen.” He was remembering a Fair-Day Riddling which had ended not with the giving of the prize goose but with a cross-eyed man in a cap of bells dying in the dirt with a dagger in his chest. Cort’s dagger. The man had been a wandering singer and acrobat who had attempted to cheat Cort by stealing the judge’s pocket-book, in which the answers were kept on small scraps of bark.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, excyooose <i class="calibre3">me</i>,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah was looking at Jake. “I forgot all about the book of riddles you carried over. May I look at it now?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sure. It’s in my pack. The answers are gone, though. Maybe that’s why Mr. Tower gave it to me for fr—” : His shoulder was suddenly seized, and with painful force.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“What</i> was his name?” Roland asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Mr. Tower,” Jake said. “Calvin Tower. Didn’t I tell you that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No.” Roland slowly relaxed his grip on Jake’s shoulder. “But now that I hear it, I suppose I’m not surprised.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had opened Jake’s pack and found <i class="calibre3">Riddle</i>-<i class="calibre3">De-Dum!</i> He tossed it to Susannah. “You know,” he said, “I always thought that dead-baby joke was pretty good. Tasteless, maybe, but pretty good.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t care about taste,” Roland said. “It’s senseless and unsolvable, and that’s what makes it silly. A good riddle is neither.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jesus! You guys <i class="calibre3">did</i> take this stuff seriously, didn’t you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake, meanwhile, had been restacking the kindling and mulling over the riddle which had started the discussion. Now he suddenly smiled. “A fire. That’s the answer, right? Dress it at night, undress it in the morning. If you change ‘dress’ to ‘build,’ it’s simple.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s it.” Roland returned Jake’s smile, but his eyes were on Susannah, watching as she thumbed through the small, tattered book. He thought, looking at her studious frown and the absent way she readjusted the yellow flower in her hair when it tried to slip free, that she alone might sense that the tattered book of riddles could be as important as <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> . . . maybe more important. He looked from her to Eddie and felt a recurrence of his irritation at Eddie’s foolish riddle. The young man bore another resemblance to Cuthbert, this one rather unfortunate: Roland sometimes felt like shaking him until his nose bled and his teeth fell out.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Soft, gunslinger—soft!</i> Cort’s voice, not quite laughing, spoke up in his head, and Roland resolutely put his emotions at arm’s length. It was easier to do that when he remembered that Eddie couldn’t help his occasional forays into nonsense; character was also at least partly formed by <i class="calibre3">ka</i>, and Roland knew well that there was more to Eddie than nonsense. Anytime he started to make the mistake of thinking that wasn’t so, he would do well to remember their conversation by the side of the road three nights before, when Eddie had accused him of using them as markers on his own private game-board. That had angered him . . . but it had been close enough to the truth to shame him, as well.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blissfully unaware of these long thoughts, Eddie now inquired: “What’s green, weighs a hundred tons, and lives at the bottom of the ocean?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I know,” Jake said. “Moby Snot, the Great Green Whale.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Idiocy,” Roland muttered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah—but that’s what’s supposed to make it funny,” Eddie said. “<i class="calibre3">Jokes</i> are supposed to make you think around corners, too. You see . . .” He looked at Roland’s face, laughed, and threw up his hands. “Never mind. I give up. You wouldn’t understand. Not in a million years. Let’s look at the damned book. I’ll even try to take it seriously . . . if we can eat a little supper first, that is.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Watch Me,” the gunslinger said with a flicker of a smile.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Huh?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That means you have a deal.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake scraped the steel across the flint. A spark jumped, and this time the kindling caught fire. He sat back contentedly and watched the flames spread, one arm slung around Oy’s neck. He felt well pleased with himself. He had started the evening fire . . . and he had guessed the answer to Roland’s riddle.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h3"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_2"><b class="calibre4">3</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “I’VE GOT ONE,” JAKE said as they ate their evening burritos.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is it a foolish one?” Roland asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nah. It’s a real one.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Then try me with it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay. What can run but never walks, has a mouth but never talks, has a bed but never sleeps, has a head but never weeps?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A good one,” Roland said kindly, “but an old one. A river.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake was a little crestfallen. “You really <i class="calibre3">are</i> hard to stump.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland tossed the last bite of his burrito to Oy, who accepted it eagerly. “Not me. I’m what Eddie calls an overpush. You should have seen Alain. He collected riddles the way a lady collects fans.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s pushover, Roland, old buddy,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thank you. Try this one: What lies in bed, and stands in bed?/ First white, then red/ The plumper it gets. The better the old woman likes it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie burst out laughing. “A dork!” he yelled. “Crude, Roland! But I like it! I <i class="calibre3">liyyyke</i> it!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “Your answer is wrong. A good riddle is sometimes a puzzle in words, like Jake’s about the river, but sometimes it’s more like a magician’s trick, making you look in one direction while it’s going somewhere else.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s a double,” Jake said. He explained what Aaron Deepneau had said about the Riddle of Samson. Roland nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is it a strawberry?” Susannah asked, then answered her own question. “Of course it is. It’s like the fire-riddle. There’s a metaphor hidden inside it. Once you understand the metaphor, you can solve the riddle.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I metaphor sex, but she slapped my face and walked away when I asked,” Eddie told them sadly. They all ignored him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you change ‘gets’ to ‘grows,’ ” Susannah went on, “it’s easy. First white, then red. Plumper it grows, the better the old woman likes it.” She looked pleased with herself.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “The answer I always heard was a wenberry, but I’m sure both answers mean the same thing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie picked up <i class="calibre3">Riddle-De-Dum</i>! and began flipping through it. “How about this one, Roland? When is a door not a door?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland frowned. “Is it another piece of your stupidity? Because my patience—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. I promised to take it seriously, and I am—I’m <i class="calibre3">trying</i>, at least. It’s in this book, and I just happen to know the answer. I heard it when I was a kid.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake, who also knew the answer, winked at Eddie. Eddie winked back, and was amused to see Oy also trying to wink. The bumbler kept shutting both eyes, and eventually gave up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland and Susannah, meanwhile, were puzzling over the question. “It must have something to do with love,” Roland said. “A door, adore. When is adore not adore . . . hmmm . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hmmm,” Oy said. His imitation of Roland’s thoughtful tone was perfect. Eddie winked at Jake again. Jake covered his mouth to hide a smile.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is the answer false love?” Roland asked at last.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nope.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Window,” Susannah said suddenly and decisively. “When is a door not a door? When it’s a window.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nope.” Eddie was grinning broadly now, but Jake was struck by how far from the real answer both of them had wandered. There was magic at work here, he thought. Pretty common stuff, as magic went, no flying carpets or disappearing elephants, but magic, all the same. He suddenly saw what they were doing—a simple game of riddles around a campfire—in an entirely new light. It was like playing blind-man’s bluff, only in this game the blindfold was made of words.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I give up,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said. “Tell if you know.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The answer is a jar. A door is not a door when it’s ajar. Get it?” Eddie watched as comprehension dawned on Roland’s face and asked, a little apprehensively, “<i class="calibre3">Is</i> it a bad one? I was trying to be serious this time, Roland—really.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not bad at all. On the contrary, it’s quite good. Cort would have gotten it, I’m sure . . . probably Alain, too, it’s still very clever. I did what I always used to do in the schoolroom: made it more complicated than it really was and shot right past the answer.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There really is something to it, isn’t there?” Eddie mused. Roland nodded, but Eddie didn’t see; he was looking into the depths of the fire, where dozens of roses bloomed and faded in the coals.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland said, “One more, and we’ll turn in. Only from tonight on, we’ll stand a watch. You first, Eddie, then Susannah. I’ll take the last one.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What about me?” Jake asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Later on you may have to take a turn. Right now it’s more important for you to get your sleep.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you really think sentry-duty is necessary?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. And that’s the best reason of all to do it. Jake, choose us a riddle from your book.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie handed <i class="calibre3">Riddle-De-Dum!</i> to Jake, who thumbed through the pages and finally stopped near the back. “Whoa! This one’s a killer.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let’s hear it,” Eddie said. “If I don’t get it, Suze will. We’re known at Fair-Days all across the land as Eddie Dean and His Riddling Queen.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’re witty tonight, ain’t we?” Susannah said. “Let’s see how witty you are after settin by the side o’ the road until midnight or so, honeychild.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake read: “ ‘There is a thing that nothing is, and yet it has a name. It’s sometimes tall and sometimes short, joins our talks, joins our sport, and plays at every game.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They discussed this riddle for almost fifteen minutes, but none of them could even hazard an answer.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Maybe it’ll come to one of us while we’re asleep,” Jake said. “That’s how I got the one about the river.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Cheap book, with the answers torn out,” Eddie said. He stood up and wrapped a hide blanket around his shoulders like a cloak.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, it <i class="calibre3">was</i> cheap. Mr. Tower gave it to me for free.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What am I looking for, Roland?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shrugged as he lay down. “I don’t know, but I think you’ll know it if you see it or hear it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wake me up when you start feeling sleepy,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You better believe it.”

  <div class="tx">
    A GRASSY DITCH RAN along the side of the road and Eddie sat on the far side of it with his blanket around his shoulders. A thin scud of clouds had veiled the sky tonight, dimming the starshow. A strong west wind was blowing. When Eddie turned his face in that direction, he could clearly smell the buffalo which now owned these plains—a mixed perfume of hot fur and fresh dung. The clarity which had returned to his senses in these last few months was amazing . . . and, at times like these, a little spooky, as well.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Very faintly, he could hear a buffalo calf bawling.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned toward the city, and after a while he began to think he might be seeing distant sparks of light there—the electric candles of the twins’ story—but he was well aware that he might be seeing nothing more than his own wishful thinking.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You’re a long way from Forty-second Street, sweetheart—hope is a great thing, no matter what anyone says, but don’t hope so hard you lose sight of that one thought: you’re a long way from Forty-second Street. That’s not New York up ahead, no matter how much you might wish it was. That’s Lud, and it’ll be whatever it is. And if you keep that in mind, maybe you’ll be okay.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He passed his time on watch trying to think of an answer to the last riddle of the evening. The scolding Roland had given him about his dead-baby joke had left him feeling disgruntled, and it would please him to be able to start off the morning by giving them a good answer. Of course they wouldn’t be able to check <i class="calibre3">any</i> answer against the back of the book, but he had an idea that with good riddles a good answer was usually self-evident.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Sometimes tall and sometimes short</i>. He thought that was the key and all the rest was probably just misdirection. What <i class="calibre3">was</i> sometimes tall and sometimes short? Pants? No. Pants were sometimes short and sometimes long, but he had never heard of tall pants. Tales? Like pants, it only fit snugly one way. <i class="calibre3">Drinks</i> were sometimes both tall and short—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Order,” he murmured, and thought for a moment that he must have stumbled across the solution—both adjectives fit the noun glove-tight. A tall order was a big job; a short order was something you got on the quick in a restaurant—a hamburger or a tuna melt. Except that tall orders and tuna melts didn’t <i class="calibre3">join our talk or play at every game</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He felt a rush of frustration and had to smile at himself, getting all wound up about a harmless word-game in a kid’s book. All the same, he found it a little easier to believe that people might really kill each other over riddles . . . if the stakes were high enough and cheating was involved.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Let it go—you’re doing exactly what Roland said, thinking right past it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Still, what else did he have to think about?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the drumming from the city began again, and he did have something else. There was no build-up; at one moment it wasn’t there, and at the next it was going full force, as if a switch had been turned. Eddie walked to the edge of the road, turned toward the city, and listened. After a few moments he looked around to see if the drums had awakened the others, but he was still alone. He turned toward Lud again and cupped his ears forward with the sides of his hands.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Bump. . . ba-bump . . . ba-bump-bumpbumpbump</i> .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Bump . . . ba-bump . . . ba-bump-bumpbumpbump.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie became more and more sure that he had been right about what it was; that he had, at least, solved this riddle.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Bump . . . ba-bump . . . ba-bump-bumpbumpbump.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The idea that he was standing by a deserted road in an almost empty world, standing some one hundred and seventy miles from a city which had been built by some fabulous lost civilization and listening to a rock-and-roll drum-line . . . that was crazy, but was it any crazier than a traffic-light that dinged and dropped a rusty green flag with the word GO printed on it? Any crazier than discovering the wreck of a German plane from the 1930s?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie sang the words to the Z.Z. Top song in a whisper:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">“You need just enough of that sticky stuff</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">To hold the seam on your fine blue-jeans</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I say yeah, yeah . . .</i> ”
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They fit the beat perfectly. It was the disco-pulse percussion of “Velcro Fly.” Eddie was sure of it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A short time later the sound ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and he could hear only the wind, and, more faintly, the Send River, which had a bed but never slept.

  <div class="tx">
    THE NEXT FOUR DAYS were uneventful. They walked; they watched the bridge and the city grow larger and define themselves more clearly; they camped; they ate; they riddled; they kept watch turn and turn about (Jake had pestered Roland into letting him keep a short watch in the two hours just before dawn); they slept. The only remarkable incident had to do with the bees.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Around noon on the third day after the discovery of the downed plane, a buzzing sound came to them, growing louder and louder until it dominated the day. At last Roland stopped. “There,” he said, and pointed toward a grove of eucalyptus trees.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It sounds like bees,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland’s faded blue eyes gleamed. “Could be we’ll have a little dessert tonight.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know how to tell you this, Roland,” Eddie said, “but I have this aversion to being stung.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t we all,” Roland agreed, “but the day is windless. I think we can smoke them to sleep and steal their comb right out from under them without setting half the world on fire. Let’s have a look.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He carried Susannah, who was as eager for the adventure as the gunslinger himself, toward the grove. Eddie and Jake lagged behind, and Oy, apparently having decided that discretion was the better part of valor, remained sitting at the edge of the Great Road, panting like a dog and watching them carefully.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland paused at the edge of the trees. “Stay where you are,” he told Eddie and Jake, speaking softly. “We’re going to have a look. I’ll give you a come-on if all’s well.” He carried Susannah into the dappled shadows of the grove while Eddie and Jake remained in the sunshine, peering after them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was cooler in the shade. The buzzing of the bees was a steady, hypnotic drone. “There are too many,” Roland murmured. “This is late summer; they should be out working. I don’t—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He caught sight of the hive, bulging tumorously from the hollow of a tree in the center of the clearing, and broke off.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s the matter with them?” Susannah asked in a soft, horrified voice. “Roland, what’s the <i class="calibre3">matter</i> with them?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A bee, as plump and slow-moving as a horsefly in October, droned past her head. Susannah flinched away from it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland motioned for the others to join them. They did, and stood looking at the hive without speaking. The chambers weren’t heat hexagons but random holes of all shapes and sizes; the beehive itself looked queerly melted, as if someone had turned a blowtorch on it. The bees which crawled sluggishly over it were as white as snow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No honey tonight,” Roland said. “What we took from yonder comb might taste sweet, but it would poison us as surely as night follows day.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One of the grotesque white bees lumbered heavily past Jake’s head. He ducked away with an expression of loathing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What did it?” Eddie asked. “What did it to them, Roland?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The same thing that has emptied this whole land; the thing that’s still causing many of the buffalo to be born as sterile freaks. I’ve heard it called the Old War, the Great Fire, the Cataclysm, and the Great Poisoning. Whatever it was, it was the start of all our troubles and it happened long ago, a thousand years before the great-great-grandfathers of the River Crossing folk were born. The physical effects—the two-headed buffalo and the white bees and such—have grown less as time passes. I have seen this for myself. The other changes are greater, if harder to see, and they are still going on.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They watched the white bees crawl, dazed and almost completely helpless, about their hive. Some were apparently trying to work; most simply wandered about, butting heads and crawling over one another. Eddie found himself remembering a newsclip he’d seen once. It had shown a crowd of survivors leaving the area where a gas-main had exploded, flattening almost a whole city block in some California town. These bees reminded him of those dazed, shellshocked survivors.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You had a nuclear war, didn’t you?” he asked—almost accused. “These Great Old Ones you like to talk about . . . they blew their great old asses straight to hell. Didn’t they?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t <i class="calibre3">know</i> what happened. No one knows. The records of those times are lost, and the few stories are confused and conflicting.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let’s get out of here,” Jake said in a trembling voice. “Looking at those things makes me sick.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m with you, sugar,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    So they left the bees to their aimless, shattered life in the grove of ancient trees, and there was no honey that night.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    “WHEN ARE YOU GOING to tell us what you <i class="calibre3">do</i> know?” Eddie asked the next morning. The day was bright and blue, but there was a bite in the air; their first autumn in this world was almost upon them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland glanced at him. “What do you mean?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’d like to hear your whole story, from beginning to end, starting with Gilead. How you grew up there and what happened to end it all. I want to know how you found out about the Dark Tower and why you started chasing after it in the first place. I want to know about your first bunch of friends, too. And what happened to them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland removed his hat, armed sweat from his brow, then replaced it. “You have the right to know all those things, I suppose, and I’ll tell them to you . . . but not now. It’s a very long story. I never expected to tell it to anyone, and I’ll only tell it once.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When?” Eddie persisted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When the time is right,” Roland said, and with that they had to be content.
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_6"><b class="calibre4">7</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND CAME AWAKE THE moment before Jake began to shake him. He sat up and looked around, but Eddie and Susannah were still fast asleep and in the first faint light of morning, he could see nothing amiss.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What is it?” he asked Jake in a low voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. Fighting, maybe. Come and listen.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland threw his blanket aside and followed Jake out to the road. He reckoned they were now only three days’ walk from the place where the Send passed in front of the city, and the bridge—built squarely along the path of the Beam—dominated the horizon. Its pronounced tilt was more clearly visible than ever, and he could see at least a dozen gaps where overstressed cables had snapped like the strings of a lyre.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tonight the wind blew directly into their faces as they looked toward the city, and the sounds it carried to them were faint but clear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Is</i> it fighting?” Jake asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded and held a finger to his lips.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He heard faint shouts, a crash that sounded like some huge object falling, and—of course—the drums. Now there was another crash, this one more musical: the sound of breaking glass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jeepers,” Jake whispered, and moved closer to the gunslinger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then came the sounds which Roland had hoped not to hear: a fast, sandy rattle of small-arms fire followed by a loud hollow bang—clearly an explosion of some kind. It rolled across the flatlands toward them like an invisible bowling ball. After that, the shouts, thuds, and sounds of breakage quickly sank below the level of the drums, and when the drums quit a few minutes later with their usual unsettling suddenness, the city was silent again. But now that silence had an unpleasant waiting quality.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland put an arm around Jake’s shoulders. “Still not too late to detour around,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake glanced up at him. “We can’t.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because of the train?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded and singsonged: “Blaine is a pain, but we <i class="calibre3">have</i> to take the train. And the city’s the only place where we can get on.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland looked thoughtfully at Jake. “Why do you say we <i class="calibre3">have</i> to? Is it <i class="calibre3">ka?</i> Because, Jake, you have to understand that you don’t know much about <i class="calibre3">ka</i> yet—it’s the sort of subject men study all their lives.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know if it’s <i class="calibre3">ka</i> or not, but I do know that we can’t go into the waste lands unless we’re protected, and that means Blaine. Without him we’ll die, like those bees we saw are going to die when winter comes. We have to be protected. Because the waste lands are poison.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How do you know these things?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t <i class="calibre3">know!</i>” Jake said, almost angrily. “I just <i class="calibre3">do.</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right,” Roland said mildly. He looked toward Lud again. “But we’ll have to be damned careful. It’s unlucky that they still have gunpowder. If they have that, they may have things that are even more powerful. I doubt if they know how to use them, but that only increases the danger. They could get excited and blow us all to hell.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ell,” a grave voice said from behind them. They glanced around and saw Oy sitting by the side of the road, watching them.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h8"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_7"><b class="calibre4">8</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    LATER THAT DAY THEY came to a new road which swept toward them out of the west and joined their own way. Beyond this point, the Great Road—now much wider and split down the middle by a median divider of some polished dark stone—began to sink, and the crumbling concrete embankments which rose on either side of them gave the pilgrims a claustrophobic trapped feeling. They stopped at a point where one of these concrete dikes had been broken open, affording a comforting line of sight to the open land beyond, and ate a light, unsatisfying meal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why do you think they dropped the road down like this, Eddie?” Jake asked. “I mean, someone <i class="calibre3">did</i> do it this way on purpose, didn’t they?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked through the break in the concrete, where the flatlands stretched on as smoothly as ever, and nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Then why?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Dunno, champ,” Eddie said, but he thought he did. He glanced at Roland and guessed that he knew, too. The sunken road leading to the bridge had been a defensive measure. Troops placed atop the concrete slopes were in control of two carefully engineered redoubts. If the defenders didn’t like the look of the folks approaching Lud along the Great Road, they could rain destruction down on them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You <i class="calibre3">sure</i> you don’t know?” Jake asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie smiled at Jake and tried to stop imagining that there was some nut up there right now, getting ready to roll a large, rusty bomb down one of those decayed concrete ramps. “No idea,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah whistled disgustedly between her teeth. “This road’s goin to hell, Roland. I was hoping we were done with that damn harness, but you better get it out again.” He nodded and rummaged in his purse for it without a word.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The condition of the Great Road deteriorated as other, smaller roads joined it like tributaries joining a great river. As they neared the bridge, the cobbles were replaced with a surface Roland thought of as metal and the rest of them thought of as asphalt or hot-top. It had not held up as well as the cobbles. Time had done some damage; the passage of countless horses and wagons since the last repairs were made had done more. The surface had been chewed into a treacherous rubble. Foot travel would be difficult, and the idea of pushing Susannah’s wheelchair over that crumbled surface was ridiculous.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The banks on either side had grown steadily steeper, and now, at their tops, they could see slim, pointed shapes looming against the sky. Roland thought of arrowheads—huge ones, weapons made by a tribe of giants. To his companions, they looked like rockets or guided missiles. Susannah thought of Red-stones fired from Cape Canaveral; Eddie thought about SAMs, some built to be fired from the backs of flatbed trucks, stored all over Europe; Jake thought of ICBMs hiding in reinforced concrete silos under the plains of Kansas and the unpopulated mountains of Nevada, programmed to hit back at China or the USSR in the event of nuclear armageddon. All of them felt as if they had passed into a dark and woeful zone of shadow, or into a countryside laboring under some old but still powerful curse.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Some hours after they entered this area—Jake called it The Gauntlet—the concrete embankments ended at a place where half a dozen access roads drew together, like the strands of a spiderweb, and here the land opened out again . . . a fact which relieved all of them, although none of them said so out loud. Another traffic-light swung over the junction. This one was more familiar to Eddie, Susannah, and Jake; it had once had lenses on its four faces, although the glass had been broken out long ago.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll bet this road was the eighth wonder of the world, once upon a time,” Susannah said, “and look at it now. It’s a minefield.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Old ways are sometimes the best ways,” Roland agreed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was pointing west. “Look.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now that the high concrete barriers were gone, they could see exactly what old Si had described to them over cups of bitter coffee in River Crossing. “One track only,” he had said, “set up high on a colyum of man-made stone, such as the Old Ones used to make their streets and walls.” The track raced toward them out of the west in a slim, straight line, then flowed across the Send and into the city on a narrow golden trestle. It was a simple, elegant construction—and the only one they had seen so far which was totally without rust—but it was badly marred, all the same. Halfway across, a large piece of the trestle had fallen into the rushing river below. What remained were two long, jutting piers that pointed at each other like accusing fingers. Jutting out of the water below the hole was a streamlined tube of metal. Once it had been bright blue, but now the color had been dimmed by spreading scales of rust. It looked very small from this distance.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So much for Blaine,” Eddie said. “No wonder they stopped hearing it. The supports finally gave way while it was crossing the river and it fell in the drink. It must have been decelerating when it happened, or it would have carried straight across and all we’d see would be a big hole like a bomb-crater in the far bank. Well, it was a great idea while it lasted.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Mercy said there was another one,” Susannah reminded him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah. She also said she hadn’t heard it in seven or eight years, and Aunt Talitha said it was more like ten. What do you think, Jake . . . Jake? Earth to Jake, Earth to Jake, come in, little buddy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake, who had been staring intently at the remains of the train in the river, only shrugged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re a big help, Jake,” Eddie said. “Valuable input—that’s why I love you. Why we <i class="calibre3">all</i> love you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake paid no attention. He knew what he was seeing, and it wasn’t Blaine. The remains of the mono sticking out of the river were blue. In his dream, Blaine had been the dusty, sugary pink of the bubble-gum you got with baseball trading cards.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland, meanwhile, had cinched the straps of Susannah’s carry-harness across his chest. “Eddie, boost your lady into this contraption. It’s time we moved on and saw for ourselves.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake now shifted his gaze, looking nervously toward the bridge looming ahead. He could hear a high, ghostly humming noise in the distance—the sound of the wind playing in the decayed steel hangers which connected the overhead cables to the concrete deck below.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you think it’ll be safe to cross?” Jake asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’ll find out tomorrow,” Roland replied.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_8"><b class="calibre4">9</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE NEXT MORNING, ROLAND’S band of travellers stood at the end of the long, rusty bridge, gazing across at Lud. Eddie’s dreams of wise old elves who had preserved a working technology on which the pilgrims could draw were disappearing. Now that they were this close, he could see holes in the city-scape where whole blocks of buildings appeared to have been either burned or blasted. The skyline reminded him of a diseased jaw from which many teeth have already fallen.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was true that most of the buildings were still standing, but they had a dreary, disused look that filled Eddie with an uncharacteristic gloom, and the bridge between the travellers and that shuttered maze of steel and concrete looked anything but solid and eternal. The vertical hangers on the left sagged slackly; the ones remaining on the right almost screamed with tension. The deck had been constructed of hollow concrete boxes shaped like trapezoids. Some of these had buckled upward, displaying empty black interiors; others had slipped askew. Many of these latter had merely cracked, but others were badly broken, leaving gaps big enough to drop trucks—<i class="calibre3">big</i> trucks—into. In places where the bottoms of the box-sections as well as the tops had shattered, they could see the muddy riverbank and the gray-green water of the Send beyond it. Eddie put the distance between the deck and the water as three hundred feet at the center of the bridge. And that was probably a conservative estimate.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie peered at the huge concrete caissons to which the main cables were anchored and thought the one on the right side of the bridge looked as if it had been pulled partway out of the earth. He decided he might do well not to mention this fact to the others; it was bad enough that the bridge was swaying slowly but perceptibly back and forth. Just looking at it made him feel seasick. “Well?” he asked Roland. “What do you think?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland pointed to the right side of the bridge. Here was a canted walkway about five feet wide. It had been constructed atop a series of smaller concrete boxes and was, in effect, a separate deck. This segmented deck appeared to be supported by an undercable—or perhaps it was a thick steel rod—anchored to the main support cables by huge bow-clamps. Eddie inspected the closest one with the avid interest of a man who may soon be entrusting his life to the object he is studying. The bow-clamp appeared rusty but still sound. The words LaMERK FOUNDRY had been stamped into its metal. Eddie was fascinated to realize he no longer knew if the words were in the High Speech or in English.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think we can use that,” Roland said. “There’s only one bad place. Do you see it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah—it’s kind of hard to miss.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bridge, which had to be at least three quarters of a mile long, might not have had any proper maintenance for over a thousand years, but Roland guessed that the real destruction might have been going on for only the last fifty or so. As the hangers on the right snapped, the bridge had listed farther and farther to the left. The greatest twist had occurred in the center of the bridge, between the two four-hundred-foot cable-towers. At the place where the pressure of the twist was the greatest, a gaping, eye-shaped hole ran across the deck. The break in the walkway was narrower, but even so, at least two adjoining concrete box-sections had fallen into the Send, leaving a gap at least twenty or thirty feet wide. Where these boxes had been, they could clearly see the rusty steel rod or cable which supported the walkway. They would have to use it to get across the gap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think we can cross,” Roland said, calmly pointing. “The gap is inconvenient, but the side-rail is still there, so we’ll have something to hold onto.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie nodded, but he could feel his heart pounding hard. The exposed walkway support looked like a big pipe made of jointed steel, and was probably four feet across at the top. In his mind’s eye he could see how they would have to edge across, feet on the broad, slightly curved back of the support, hands clutching the rail, while the bridge swayed slowly like a ship in a mild swell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jesus,” he said. He tried to spit, but nothing came out. His mouth was too dry. “You sure, Roland?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So far as I can see, it’s the only way.” Roland pointed downriver and Eddie saw a second bridge. This one had fallen into the Send long ago. The remains stuck out of the water in a rusted tangle of ancient steel.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What about you, Jake?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hey, no problem,” Jake said at once. He was actually smiling.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I hate you, kid,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland was looking at Eddie with some concern. “If you feel you can’t do it, say so now. Don’t get halfway across and then freeze up.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked along the twisted surface of the bridge for a long time, then nodded. “I guess I can handle it. Heights have never been my favorite thing, but I’ll manage.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good.” Roland surveyed them. “Soonest begun, soonest done. I’ll go first, with Susannah. Then Jake, and Eddie’s drogue. Can you handle the wheelchair?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hey, no problem,” Eddie said giddily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let’s go, then.”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_9"><b class="calibre4">10</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    As SOON AS HE stepped onto the walkway, fear filled up Eddie’s hollow places like cold water and he began to wonder if he hadn’t made a very dangerous mistake. From solid ground, the bridge seemed to be swaying only a little, but once he was actually on it, he felt as if he were standing on the pendulum of the world’s biggest grandfather clock. The movement was very slow, but it was regular, and the length of the swings was much longer than he had anticipated. The walkway’s surface was badly cracked and canted at least ten degrees to the left. His feet gritted in loose piles of powdery concrete, and the low squealing sound of the box-segments grinding together was constant. Beyond the bridge, the city skyline tilted slowly back and forth like the artificial horizon of the world’s slowest-moving video game.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Overhead, the wind hummed constantly in the taut hangers. Below, the ground fell away sharply to the muddy northwest bank of the river. He was thirty feet up . . . then sixty . . . then a hundred and ten. Soon he would be over the water. The wheelchair banged against his left leg with every step.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Something furry brushed between his feet and he clutched madly for the rusty handrail with his right hand, barely holding in a scream. Oy went trotting past him with a brief upward glance, as if to say <i class="calibre3">Excuse me—just passing.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fucking dumb animal,” Eddie said through gritted teeth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He discovered that, although he didn’t like looking down, he had an even greater aversion to looking at the hangers which were still managing to hold the deck and the overhead cables together. They were sleeved with rust and Eddie could see snarls of metal thread poking out of most—these snarls looked like metallic puffs of cotton. He knew from his Uncle Reg, who had worked on both the George Washington and Triborough bridges as a painter, that the hangers and overhead cables were “spun” from thousands of steel threads. On this bridge, the spin was finally letting go. The hangers were quite literally becoming unravelled, and as they did, the threads were snapping, one interwoven strand at a time.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s held this long, it’ll hold a little longer. You think this thing’s going. to fall into the river just because you’re crossing it? Don’t flatter yourself.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He wasn’t comforted, however. For all Eddie knew, they might be the first people to attempt the crossing in <i class="calibre3">decades</i>. And the bridge, after all, would have to collapse <i class="calibre3">sometime</i>, and from the look of things, it was going to be soon. Their combined weight might be the straw that broke the camel’s back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His moccasin struck a chunk of concrete and Eddie watched, sickened but helpless to look away, as the chunk fell down and down and down, turning over as it went. There was a small—<i class="calibre3">very</i> small-splash when it hit the river. The freshening wind gusted and stuck his shirt against his sweaty skin. The bridge groaned and swayed. Eddie tried to remove his hands from the side-rail, but they seemed frozen to the pitted metal in a deathgrip.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He closed his eyes for a moment. <i class="calibre3">You’re not going to freeze. You’re not. I . . . I forbid it. If you need something to look at, make it long tall and ugly</i>. Eddie opened his eyes again, fixed them on the gunslinger, forced his hands to open, and began to move forward again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND REACHED THE GAP and looked back. Jake was five feet behind him. Oy was at his heels. The bumbler was crouched down with his neck stretched forward. The wind was much stronger over the river-cut, and Roland could see it rippling Oy’s silky fur. Eddie was about twenty-five feet behind Jake. His face was tightly drawn, but he was still shuffling grimly along with Susannah’s collapsed wheelchair in his left hand. His right was clutching the rail like grim death.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Susannah?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” she responded at once. “Fine.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jake?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked up. He was still grinning, and the gunslinger saw there was going to be no problem there. The boy was having the time of his life. His hair blew back from his finely made brow in waves, and his eyes sparkled. He jerked one thumb up. Roland smiled and returned the gesture.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t worry about me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie appeared to be looking at Roland, but the gunslinger decided he was really looking past him, at the windowless brick buildings which crowded the riverbank at the far end of the bridge. That was all right; given his obvious fear of heights, it was probably the best thing he could do to keep his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right, I won’t,” Roland murmured. “We’re going to cross the hole now, Susannah. Sit easy. No quick movements. Understand?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you want to adjust your position, do it now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m fine, Roland,” she said calmly. “I just hope Eddie will be all right.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie’s a gunslinger now. He’ll behave like one.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland turned to the right, so he was facing directly downriver, and grasped the handrail. Then he began to edge out across the hole, shuffling his boots along the rusty cable.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_11"><b class="calibre4">12</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE WAITED UNTIL ROLAND and Susannah were part of the way across the gap and then started himself. The wind gusted and the bridge swayed back and forth, but he felt no alarm at all. He was, in fact, totally buzzed. Unlike Eddie, he’d never had any fear of heights; he liked being up here where he could see the river spread out like a steel ribbon under a sky which was beginning to cloud over.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Halfway across the hole in the bridge (Roland and Susannah had reached the place where the uneven walkway resumed and were watching the others), Jake looked back and his heart sank. They had forgotten one member of the party when they were discussing how to cross. Oy was crouched, frozen and clearly terrified, on the far side of the hole in the walkway. He was sniffing at the place where the concrete ended and the rusty, curved support took over.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, Oy!” Jake called.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy!” the bumbler called back, and the tremble in his hoarse voice was almost human. He stretched his long neck forward toward Jake but didn’t move. His gold-ringed eyes were huge and dismayed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Another gust of wind struck the bridge, making it sway and squall. Something twanged beside Jake’s head—the sound of a guitar string which has been tightened until it snaps. A steel thread had popped out of the nearest vertical hanger, almost scratching his cheek. Ten feet away, Oy crouched miserably with his eyes fixed on Jake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on!” Roland shouted. “Wind’s freshening! Come on, Jake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not without Oy!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake began to shuffle back the way he had come. Before he had gone more than two steps, Oy stepped gingerly onto the support rod. The claws at the ends of his stiffly braced legs scratched at the rounded metal surface. Eddie stood behind the bumbler now, feeling helpless and scared to death.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s it, Oy!” Jake encouraged. “Come to me!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy-Oy! Ake-Ake!” the bumbler cried, and trotted rapidly along the rod. He had almost reached Jake when the traitorous wind gusted again. The bridge swung. Oy’s claws scratched madly at the support rod for purchase, but there was none. His hindquarters slued off the edge and into space. He tried to cling with his forepaws, but there was nothing to cling to. His rear legs ran wildly in midair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake let go of the rail and dived for him, aware of nothing but Oy’s gold-ringed eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“No, Jake!</i>” Roland and Eddie bellowed together, each from his own side of the gap, each too far away to do anything but watch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake hit the cable on his chest and belly. His pack bounced against his shoulderblades and he heard his teeth click together in his head with the sound of a cueball breaking a tight rack. The wind gusted again. He went with it, looping his right hand around the support rod and reaching for Oy with his left as he swayed out into space. The bumbler began to fall, and clamped his jaws on Jake’s reaching hand as he did. The pain was immediate and excruciating. Jake screamed but held on, head down, right arm clasping the rod, knees pressing hard against its wretchedly smooth surface. Oy dangled from his left hand like a circus acrobat, staring up with his gold-ringed eyes, and Jake could now see his own blood flowing along the sides of the bumbler’s head in thin streams.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the wind gusted again and Jake began to slip outward.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h13"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_12"><b class="calibre4">13</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE’S FEAR LEFT HIM. In, its place came that strange yet welcome coldness. He dropped Susannah’s wheelchair to the cracked cement with a clatter and raced nimbly out along the support cable, not even bothering with the handrail. Jake hung head-down over the gap with Oy swinging at the end of his left hand like a furry pendulum. And the boy’s right hand was slipping.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie opened his legs and seat-dropped to a sitting position. His undefended balls smashed painfully up into his crotch, but for the moment even this exquisite pain was news from a distant country. He seized Jake by the hair with one hand and one strap of his pack with the other. He felt himself beginning to tilt outward, and for a nightmarish moment he thought all three of them were going to go over in a daisy-chain.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He let go of Jake’s hair and tightened his grip on the packstrap, praying the kid hadn’t bought the pack at one of the cheap discount outlets. He flailed above his head for the handrail with his free hand. After an interminable moment in which their combined outward slide continued, he found it and seized it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“ROLAND!</i>” he bawled. <i class="calibre3">“I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP HERE!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But Roland was already there, with Susannah still perched on his back. When he bent, she locked her arms around his neck so she wouldn’t drop headfirst from the sling. The gunslinger wrapped an arm around Jake’s chest and pulled him up. When his feet were on the support rod again, Jake put his right arm around Oy’s trembling body. His left hand was an agony of fire and ice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let go, Oy,” he gasped. “You can let go now we’re—safe.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a terrible moment he didn’t think the billy-bumbler would. Then, slowly, Oy’s jaws relaxed and Jake was able to pull his hand free. It was covered with blood and dotted with a ring of dark holes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy,” the bumbler said feebly, and Eddie saw with wonder that the animal’s strange eyes were full of tears. He stretched his neck and licked Jake’s face with his bloody tongue.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s okay,” Jake said, pressing his face into the warm fur. He was crying himself, his face a mask of shock and pain. “Don’t worry, that’s okay. You couldn’t help it and I don’t mind.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was getting slowly to his feet. His face was dirty gray, and he felt as if someone had driven a bowling ball into his guts. His left hand stole slowly to his crotch and investigated the damage there.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Cheap fucking vasectomy,” he said hoarsely.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you going to faint, Eddie?” Roland asked. A fresh gust of wind flipped his hat from his head and into Susannah’s face. She grabbed it and jammed it down all the way to his ears, giving Roland the look of a half-crazed hillbilly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” Eddie said. “I almost wish I could, but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take a look at Jake,” Susannah said. “He’s really bleeding.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m fine,” Jake said, and tried to hide his hand. Roland took it gently in his own hands before he could. Jake had sustained at least a dozen puncture-wounds in the back of his hand, his palm, and his fingers. Most of them were deep. It would be impossible to tell if bones had been broken or tendons severed until Jake tried to flex the hand, and this wasn’t the time or place for such experiments.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland looked at Oy. The billy-bumbler looked back, his expressive eyes sad and frightened. He had made no effort to lick Jake’s blood from his chops, although it would have been the most natural thing in the world for him to have done so.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Leave him alone,” Jake said, and wrapped the encircling arm more tightly about Oy’s body. “It wasn’t his fault. It was my fault for forgetting him. The wind blew him off.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m not going to hurt him,” Roland said. He was positive the billy-bumbler wasn’t rabid, but he still did not intend for Oy to taste any more of Jake’s blood than he already had. As for any other diseases Oy might be carrying in his blood . . . well, <i class="calibre3">ka</i> would decide, as, in the end, it always did. Roland pulled his neckerchief free and wiped Oy’s lips and muzzle. “There,” he said. “Good fellow. Good boy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy,” the billy-bumbler said feebly, and Susannah, who was watching over Roland’s shoulder, could have sworn she heard gratitude in that voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Another gust of wind struck them. The weather was turning dirty, and fast. “Eddie, we have to get off the bridge. Can you walk?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No, massa; I’sa gwinter shuffle.” The pain in his groin and the pit of his stomach was still bad, but not quite so bad as it had been a minute ago.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right. Let’s move. Fast as we can.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland turned, began to take a step, and stopped. A man was now standing on the far side of the gap, watching them expressionlessly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The newcomer had approached while their attention was focused on Jake and Oy. A crossbow was slung across his back. He wore a bright yellow scarf around his head; the ends streamed out like banners in the freshening wind. Gold hoops with crosses in their centers dangled from his ears. One eye was covered with a white silk patch. His face was blotched with purple sores, some of them open and festering. He might have been thirty, forty, or sixty. He held one hand high over his head. In it was something Roland could not make out, except that its shape was too regular to be a stone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Behind this apparition, the city loomed with a kind of weird clarity in the darkening day. As Eddie looked past the huddles of brick buildings on the other shore—warehouses long since scooped empty by looters, he had no doubt—and into those shadowy canyons and stone mazes, he understood for the first time how terribly mistaken, how terribly foolish, his dreams of hope and help had been. Now he saw the shattered facades and broken roofs; now he saw the shaggy birds’ nests on cornices and in glassless, gaping windows; now he allowed himself to actually <i class="calibre3">smell</i> the city, and that odor was not of fabulous spices and savory foods of the sort his mother had sometimes brought home from Zabar’s but rather the stink of a mattress that has caught fire, smouldered awhile, and then been put out with sewer-water. He suddenly understood Lud, understood it completely. The grinning pirate who had appeared while their attention was elsewhere was probably as close to a wise old elf as this broken, dying place could provide.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland pulled his revolver.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Put it away, my cully,” the man in the yellow scarf said in an accent so thick that the sense of his words was almost lost. “Put it away, my dear heart. Ye’re a fierce trim, ay, that’s clear, but this time you’re outmatched.”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h14"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_13"><b class="calibre4">14</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE NEWCOMER’S PANTS WERE patched green velvet, and as he stood on the edge of the hole in the bridge, he looked like a buccaneer at the end of his days of plunder: sick, ragged, and still dangerous.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Suppose I choose not to?” Roland asked. “Suppose I choose to simply put a bullet through your scrofulous head?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Then I’ll get to hell just enough ahead of ye to hold the door,” the man in the yellow scarf said, and chuckled chummily. He wiggled the hand he held in the air. “It’s all the same jolly fakement to me, one way or t’other.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland guessed that was the truth. The man looked as if he might have a year to live at most . . . and the last few months of that year would probably be very unpleasant. The oozing sores on his face had nothing to do with radiation; unless Roland was badly deceived, this man was in the late stages of what the doctors called mandrus and everyone else called whore’s blossoms. Facing a dangerous man was always a bad business, but at least one could calculate the odds in such an encounter. When you were facing the dead, however, everything changed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do yer know what I’ve got here, my dear ones?” the pirate asked. “Do yer ken whatcher old friend Gasher just happens to have laid his hands on? It’s a grenado, something pretty the Old Folks left behind, and I’ve already tipped its cap—for to wear one’s cap before the introductin’ is complete would be wery bad manners, so it would!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He cackled happily for a moment, and then his face grew still and grave once more. All humor left it, as if a switch had been turned somewhere in his degenerating brains.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “My finger is all that’s holdin the pin now, dearie. If you shoot me, there’s going to be a wery big bang. You and the cunt-monkey on yer back will be vaporized. The squint, too, I reckon. The young buck standing behind you and pointing that toy pistol in my face might live, but only until he hits the water . . . and hit it he would, because this bridge has been hangin by a thread these last forty year, and all it’d take to finish it is one little push. So do ye want to put away your iron, or shall we all toddle off to hell on the same handcart?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland briefly considered trying to shoot the object Gasher called a grenado out of his hand, saw how tightly the man was gripping it, and holstered his gun.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ah, good!” Gasher cried, cheerful once more. “I knew ye was a trig cove, just lookin at yer! Oh yes! So I did!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What do you want?” Roland asked, although he thought he already knew this, too.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher raised his free hand and pointed a dirty finger at Jake. “The squint. Gimme the squint and the rest of you go free.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go fuck yourself,” Susannah said at once.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why not?” the pirate cackled. “Gimme a chunk of mirror and I’ll rip it right off and stick it right in—why not, for all the good it’s a-doin me these days? Why, I can’t even run water through it without it burns me all the way to the top of my gullywash!” His eyes, which were a strange calm shade of gray, never left Roland’s face. “What do <i class="calibre3">you</i> say, my good old mate?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What happens to the rest of us if I hand over the boy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why. you go on yer way without no trouble from us!” the man in the yellow headscarf returned promptly. “You have the Tick-Tock Man’s word on that. It comes from his lips to my lips to your ears, so it does, and Tick-Tock’s a trig cove, too, what don’t break his word once it’s been given. I can’t say ary word nor watch about any Pubies you might run into, but you’ll have no trouble with the Tick-Tock Man’s Grays. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What the fuck are you <i class="calibre3">saying</i>, Roland?” Eddie roared. “You’re not really thinking about doing it, are you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland didn’t look down at Jake, and his lips didn’t move as he murmured: “I’ll keep my promise.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes—I know you will.” Then Jake raised his voice and said: “Put the gun away, Eddie. I’ll decide.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jake, you’re out of your <i class="calibre3">mind!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The pirate cackled cheerily. “Not at all, cully! <i class="calibre3">You’re</i> the one who’s lost his mind if you disbelieve me. At the wery least, he’ll be safe from the drums with us, won’t he? And just think—if I didn’t mean what I say, I would have told you to toss your guns overside first thing! Easiest thing in the world! But did I? Nay!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah had heard the exchange between Jake and Roland. She had also had a chance to realize how bleak their options were as things now stood. “Put it away, Eddie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How do we know you won’t toss the grenade at us once you have the kid?” Eddie called.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll shoot it out of the air if he tries,” Roland said. “I can do it, and he <i class="calibre3">knows</i> I can do it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Mayhap I do. You’ve got a cosy look about you, indeed ye do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If he’s telling the truth,” Roland went on, “he’d be burned even if I missed his toy, because the bridge would collapse and we’d all go down. together.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wery clever, my dear old son!” Gasher said. “You <i class="calibre3">are</i> a cosy one, ain’t you?” He cawed laughter, then grew serious and confiding. “The talking’s done, old mate of mine. Decide. Will you give me the boy, or do we all march to the end of the path together?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Before Roland could say a word, Jake had slipped past him on the support rod. He still held Oy curled in his right arm. He held his bloody left hand stiffly out in front of him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jake, <i class="calibre3">no!”</i> Eddie shouted desperately.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll come for you,” Roland said in the same low voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I know,” Jake repeated. The wind gusted again. The bridge swayed and groaned. The Send was now speckled with whitecaps, and water boiled whitely around the wreck of the blue mono jutting from the river on the upstream side.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay, my cully!” Gasher crooned. His lips spread wide, revealing a few remaining teeth that jutted from his white gums like decayed tombstones. “Ay, my fine young squint! Just keep coming.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland, he could be bluffing!” Eddie yelled. “That thing could be a dud!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger made no reply.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As Jake neared the other side of the hole in the walkway, Oy bared his own teeth and began to snarl at Gasher.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Toss that talking bag of guts overside,” Gasher said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fuck you,” Jake replied in the same calm voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The pirate looked surprised for a moment, then nodded. “Tender of him, are you? Wery well.” He took two steps backward. “Put him down the second you reach the concrete, then. And if he runs at me, I promise to kick his brains right out his tender little asshole.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Asshole,” Oy said through his bared teeth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shut up, Oy,” Jake muttered. He reached the concrete just as the strongest gust of wind yet struck the bridge. This time the twanging sound of parting cable-strands seemed to come from everywhere. Jake glanced back and saw Roland and Eddie clinging to the rail. Susannah was watching him from over Roland’s shoulder, her tight cap of curls rippling and shaking in the wind. Jake raised his hand to them. Roland raised his in return.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You won’t let me drop this time</i>? he had asked. <i class="calibre3">No</i>—<i class="calibre3">not ever again</i>, Roland had replied. Jake believed him . . . but he was very much afraid of what might happen before Roland arrived. He put Oy down. Gasher rushed forward the moment he did, kicking out at the small animal. Oy skittered aside, avoiding the booted foot.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Run!” Jake shouted. Oy did, shooting past them and loping toward the Lud end of the bridge with his head down, swerving to avoid the holes and leaping across the cracks in the pavement. He didn’t look back. A moment later Gasher had his arm around Jake’s neck. He stank of dirt and decaying flesh, the two odors combining to create a single deep stench, crusty and thick. It made Jake’s gorge rise.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He bumped his crotch into Jake’s buttocks. “Maybe I ain’t quite s’far gone’s I thought. Don’t they say youth’s the wine what makes old men drunk? We’ll have us a time, won’t we, my sweet little squint? Ay, we’ll have a time such as will make the angels sing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Oh Jesus</i>, Jake thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher raised his voice again. “We’re leaving now, my hardcase friend—we have grand things to do and grand people to see, so we do, but I keep my word. As for you, you’ll stand right where you are for a good fifteen minutes, if you’re wise. If I see you start to move, we’re all going to ride the handsome. Do you understand me?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you believe me when I say I have nothing to lose?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s wery well, then. Move, boy! Hup!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher’s hold tightened on Jake’s throat until he could hardly breathe. At the same time he was pulled backward. They retreated that way, facing the gap where Roland stood with Susannah on his back and Eddie just behind him, still holding the Ruger which Gasher had called a toy pistol. Jake could feel Gasher’s breath puffing against his ear in hot little blurts. Worse, he could smell it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t try a thing,” Gasher whispered, “or I’ll rip off yer sweetmeats and stuff em up your bung. And it would be sad to lose em before you ever got a chance to use em, wouldn’t it? Wery sad indeed.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They reached the end of the bridge. Jake stiffened, believing Gasher would throw the grenade anyway, but he didn’t . . . at least not immediately. He backed Jake through a narrow alley between two small cubicles which had probably served as tollbooths, once upon a time. Beyond them, the brick warehouses loomed like prison cellblocks.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now, cully, I’m going to let go of your neck, or how would’je ever have wind to run with? But I’ll be holdin yer arm, and if ye don’t run like the wind, I promise I’ll rip it right off and use it for a club to beat you with. Do you understand?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded, and suddenly the terrible, stifling pressure was gone from his windpipe. As soon as it was, he became aware of his hand again—it felt hot and swollen and full of fire. Then Gasher seized his bicep with fingers like bands of iron, and he forgot all about his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Toodle-doo!” Gasher called in a grotesquely cheery falsetto. He waggled the grenado at the others. “Bye-bye, dears!” Then he growled to Jake: “Now <i class="calibre3">run</i>, you whoring little squint! <i class="calibre3">Run!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake was first whirled and then yanked into a run. The two of them went flying down a curved ramp to street level. Jake’s first confused thought was that this was what the East River Drive would look like two or three hundred years after some weird brain-plague had killed all the sane people in the world.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The ancient, rusty hulks of what had once surely been automobiles stood at intervals along both curbs. Most were bubble-shaped roadsters that looked like no cars Jake had ever seen before (except, maybe, for the ones the white-gloved creations of Walt Disney drove in the comic books), but among them he saw an old Volkswagen Beetle, a car that might have been a Chevrolet Corvair, and something he believed was a Model A Ford. There were no tires on any of these eerie hulks; they either had been stolen or had rotted away to dust long since. And all the glass had been broken, as if the remaining denizens of this city abhorred anything which might show them their own reflections, even accidentally.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Beneath and between the abandoned cars, the gutters were filled with drifts of unidentifiable metal junk and bright glints of glass. Trees had been planted at intervals along the sidewalks in some long-gone, happier time, but they were now so emphatically dead that they looked like stark metal sculptures against the cloudy sky. Some of the warehouses had either been bombed or had collapsed on their own, and beyond the jumbled heaps of bricks which was all that remained of them Jake could see the river and the rusty, sagging underpinnings of the Send Bridge. That smell of wet decay—a smell that seemed almost to snarl in the nose—was stronger than ever.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The street headed due east, diverging from the path of the Beam, and Jake could see it became more and more choked with rubble and rickrack as it went. Six or seven blocks down it appeared to be entirely plugged, but it was in this direction that Gasher pulled him. At first he kept up, but Gasher was setting a fearsome pace. Jake began to pant and fell a step behind. Gasher almost jerked him off his feet as he dragged Jake toward the barrier of junk and concrete and rusty steel beams which lay ahead. The plug—which looked like a deliberate construction to Jake—lay between two broad buildings with dusty marble facades. In front of the one on the left was a statue Jake recognized at once: it was the woman called Blind Justice, and that almost surely made the building she guarded a courthouse. But he only had a moment to look; Gasher was dragging him relentlessly toward the barricade, and he wasn’t slowing down.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">He’ll kill us if he tries to take us through there</i>! Jake thought, but Gasher—who ran like the wind in spite of the disease which advertised itself on his face—simply buried his fingers deeper in Jake’s upper arm and swept him along. And now Jake saw a narrow alley in the not-quite-haphazard pile of concrete, splintered furniture, rusted plumbing fixtures, and chunks of trucks and automobiles. He suddenly understood. This maze would hold Roland up for hours . . . but it was Gasher’s back yard, and he knew <i class="calibre3">exactly</i> where he was going.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The small dark opening to the alley was on the left side of the tottery pile of junk. As they reached it, Gasher tossed the green object back over his shoulder. “Better duck, dearie!” he cried, and voiced a series of shrill, hysterical giggles. A moment later a huge, crumping explosion shook the street. One of the bubble-shaped cars jumped twenty feet into the air and then came down on its roof. A hail of bricks whistled over Jake’s head, and something thumped him hard on the left shoulder-blade. He stumbled and would have fallen if Gasher hadn’t yanked him upright and pulled him into the narrow opening in the rubble. Once they were in the passageway which lay beyond, gloomy shadows reached out eagerly and enfolded them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When they were gone, a small, furry shape crept out from behind a concrete boulder. It was Oy. He stood at the mouth of the passage for a moment, neck stretched forward, eyes gleaming. Then he followed after, nose low to the ground and sniffing carefully.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_14"><b class="calibre4">15</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “COME ON,” ROLAND SAID as soon as Gasher had turned tail.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How could you do it?” Eddie asked. “How could you let that freak have him?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because I had no choice. Bring the wheelchair. We’re going to need it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They had reached the concrete on the far side of the gap when an explosion shook the bridge, spraying rubble into the darkening sky.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Christ!” Eddie said, and turned his white, dismayed face to Roland.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t worry yet,” Roland said calmly. “Fellows like Gasher rarely get careless with their high-explosive toys.” They reached the tollbooths at the end of the bridge. Roland stopped just beyond, at the top of the curving ramp.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You knew the guy wasn’t just bluffing, didn’t you?” Eddie said. “I mean, you weren’t guessing—you <i class="calibre3">knew.</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He’s a walking dead man, and such men don’t need to bluff.” Roland’s voice was calm enough, but there was a deep undertone of bitterness and pain in it. “I knew something like this could happen, and if we’d seen the fellow earlier, while we were still beyond the range of his exploding egg, we could have stood him off. But then Jake fell and he got too close. I imagine he thinks our real reason for bringing a boy in the first place was to pay for safe conduct through the city. Damn! Damn the luck!” Roland struck his fist against his leg.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, let’s go get him!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “This is where we split up. We can’t take Susannah where the bastard’s gone, and we can’t leave her alone.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Listen and don’t argue—not if you want to save Jake. The longer we stand here, the colder his trail gets. Cold trails are hard to follow. You’ve got your own job to do. If there’s another Blaine, and I am sure Jake believes there is, then you and Susannah must find it. There must be a station, or what was once called a cradle in the far lands. Do you understand?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For once, blessedly, Eddie didn’t argue. “Yeah. We’ll find it. What then?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fire a shot every half hour or so. When I get Jake, I’ll come.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shots may attract other people as well,” Susannah said. Eddie had helped her out of the sling and she was seated in her chair again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland surveyed them coldly. “Handle them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay.” Eddie stuck out his hand and Roland took it briefly. “Find him, Roland.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, I’ll find him. Just pray to your gods that I find him soon enough. And remember the faces of your fathers, both of you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah nodded. “We’ll try.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland turned and ran light-footed down the ramp. When he was out of sight, Eddie looked at Susannah and was not very surprised to see she was crying. He felt like crying himself. Half an hour ago they had been a tight little band of friends. Their comfortable fellowship had been smashed to bits in the space of just a few minutes—Jake abducted, Roland gone after him. Even Oy had run away. Eddie had never felt so lonely in his life.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I have a feeling we’re never going to see either of them again,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Of course we will!” Eddie said roughly, but he knew what she meant, because he felt the same way. The premonition that their quest was all over before it was fairly begun lay heavy on his heart. “In a fight with Attila the Hun, I’d give you three-to-two odds on Roland the Barbarian. Come on, Suze—we’ve got a train to catch.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But where?” she asked forlornly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. Maybe we should just find the nearest wise old elf and ask him, huh?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What are you talking about, Edward Dean?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nothing,” he said, and because that was so goddam true he thought he might burst into tears, he grasped the handles of her wheelchair and began to push it down the cracked and glass-littered ramp that led into the city of Lud.

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE QUICKLY DESCENDED INTO a foggy world where the only landmarks were pain: his throbbing hand, the place on his upper arm where Gasher’s fingers dug in like steel pegs, his burning lungs. Before they had gone far, these pains were first joined and then overmatched by a deep, burning stitch in his left side. He wondered if Roland was following after them yet. He also wondered how long Oy would be able to live in this world which was so unlike the plains and forest which were all he had known until now. Then Gasher clouted him across the face, bloodying his nose, and thought was lost in a red wash of pain.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, yer little bastard! Move yer sweet cheeks!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Running . . . as fast as I can,” Jake gasped, and just managed to dodge a thick shard of glass which jutted like a long transparent tooth from the wall of junk to his left.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You better not be, because I’ll knock yer cold and drag yer along by the hair o’ yer head if y’are! Now <i class="calibre3">hup</i>, you little barstard!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake somehow forced himself to run faster. He’d gone into the alley with the idea that they must shortly re-emerge onto the avenue, but he now reluctantly realized that wasn’t going to happen. This was more than an alley; it was a camouflaged and fortified road leading ever deeper into the country of the Grays. The tall, tottery walls which pressed in on them had been built from an exotic array of materials: cars which had been partially or completely flattened by the chunks of granite and steel placed on top of them; marble pillars; unknown factory machines which were dull red with rust wherever they weren’t still black with grease; a chrome-and-crystal fish as big as a private plane with one cryptic word of the High Speech—DELIGHT—Carefully incised into its scaly gleaming side; crisscrossing chains, each link as big as Jake’s head, wrapped around mad jumbles of furniture that appeared to balance above them as precariously as circus elephants do on their tiny steel platforms.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They came to a place where this lunatic path branched, and Gasher chose the left fork without hesitation. A little further along, three more alleyways, these so narrow they were almost tunnels, spoked off in various directions. This time Gasher chose the right-hand branching. The new path, which seemed to be formed by banks of rotting boxes and huge blocks of old paper—paper that might once have been books or magazines—was too narrow for them to run in side by side. Gasher shoved Jake into the lead and began beating him relentlessly on the back to make him go faster. <i class="calibre3">This is how a steer must feel when it’s driven down the chute to the slaughtering pen</i>, Jake thought, and vowed that if he got out of this alive, he would never eat steak again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Run, my sweet little boycunt! <i class="calibre3">Run</i>!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake soon lost all track of the twistings and turnings they made, and as Gasher drove him deeper and deeper into this jumble of torn steel, broken furniture, and castoff machinery, he began to give up hope of rescue. Not even Roland would be able to find him now. If the gunslinger tried, he would become lost himself, and wander the choked paths of this nightmare world until he died.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now they were going downhill, and the walls of tightly packed paper had given way to ramparts of filing cabinets, jumbles of adding machines, and piles of computer gear. It was like running through some nightmarish Radio Shack warehouse. For almost a full minute the wall flowing past on Jake’s left appeared to be constructed solely of either TV sets or carelessly stacked video display terminals. They stared at him like the glazed eyes of dead men. And as the pavement beneath their feet continued to descend, Jake realized that they were in a tunnel. The strip of cloudy sky overhead narrowed to a band, the band narrowed to a ribbon, and the ribbon became a thread. They were in a gloomy netherworld, scurrying like rats through a gigantic trash-midden.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What if it all comes down on us?</i> Jake wondered, but in his current state of aching exhaustion, this possibility did not frighten him much. If the roof fell in, he would at least be able to rest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher drove him as a farmer would a mule, striking his left shoulder to indicate a left turn and his right to indicate a right turn. When the course was straight on, he thumped Jake on the back of the head. Jake tried to dodge a jutting pipe and didn’t quite succeed. It whacked into one hip and sent him flailing across the narrow passage toward a snarl of glass and jagged boards. Gasher caught him and shoved him forward again. “Run, you clumsy squint! Can’t you run? If it wasn’t for the Tick-Tock Man, I’d bugger you right here and cut yer throat while I did it, ay, so I would!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake ran in a red daze where there was only pain and the frequent thud of Gasher’s fists coming down on his shoulders or the back of his head. At last, when he was sure he could run no longer, Gasher grabbed him by the neck and yanked him to a stop so fiercely that Jake crashed into him with a strangled squawk.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Here’s</i> a tricky little bit!” Gasher panted jovially. “Look straight ahead and you’ll see two wires what cross in an X low to the ground. Do yer see em?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At first Jake didn’t. It was very gloomy here; heaps of huge copper kettles were piled up to the left, and to the right were stacks of steel tanks that looked like scuba-diving gear. Jake thought he could turn these latter into an avalanche with one strong breath. He swiped his forearm across his eyes, brushing away tangles of hair, and tried not to think about how he’d look with about sixteen tons of those tanks piled on top of him. He squinted in the direction Gasher was pointing. Yes, he could make out—barely—two thin, silvery lines that looked like guitar or banjo strings. They came down from opposite sides of the passageway and crossed about two feet above the pavement.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Crawl under, dear heart. And be ever so careful, for if you so much as twang one of those wires, harf the steel and cement puke in the city’ll come down on your dear little head. Mine, too, although I doubt if that’d disturb you much, would it? Now crawl!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake shrugged out of his pack, lay down, and pushed it through the gap ahead of him. And as he eased his way under the thin, taut wires, he discovered that he wanted to live a little longer after all. It seemed that he could actually feel all those tons of carefully balanced junk waiting to come down on him. <i class="calibre3">These wires are probably holding a couple of carefully chosen keystones in place, he thought. If one of them breaks . . . ashes, ashes, we all fall down.</i> His back brushed one of the wires, and high overhead, something creaked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Careful, cully!” Gasher almost moaned. “Be oh so careful!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake pushed himself beneath the crisscrossing wires, using his feet and his elbows. His stinking, sweat-clogged hair fell in his eyes again, but he did not dare brush it away.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re clear,” Gasher grunted at last, and slipped beneath the tripwires himself with the ease of long practice. He stood up and snatched Jake’s pack before Jake could reshoulder it. “What’s in here, cully?” he asked, undoing the straps and peering in. “Got any treats for yer old pal? For the Gasherman loves his treaties, so he does!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There’s nothing in there but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher’s hand flashed out and rocked Jake’s head back with a hard slap that sent a fresh spray of bloody froth flying from the boy’s nose.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What did you do that for?” Jake cried, hurt and outraged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “For tellin me what my own beshitted eyes can see!” Gasher yelled, and cast Jake’s pack aside. He bared his remaining teeth at the boy in a dangerous, terrible grin. “And fer almost bringin the whole beshitted works down on us!” He paused, then added in a quieter voice: “<i class="calibre3">And</i> because I felt like it—I must admit that. Your stupid sheep’s face puts me wery much in a slappin temper, so it does.” The grin widened, revealing his oozing whitish gums, a sight Jake could have done without. “If your hardcase friend follows us this far, he’ll have a surprise when he runs into those wires, won’t he?” Gasher looked up, still grinning. “There’s a city bus balanced up there someplace, as I remember.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake began to weep—tired, hopeless tears that cut through the dirt on his cheeks in narrow channels.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher raised an open, threatening hand. “Get moving, cully, before I start cryin myself . . . for a wery sentermental fellow is yer old pal, so he is, and when he starts to grieve and mourn, a little slappin is the only thing to put a smile on his face again. <i class="calibre3">Run</i>!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They ran. Gasher chose pathways leading deeper into the smelly, creaking maze seemingly at random, indicating his choices with hard whacks to the shoulders. At some point the sound of the drums began. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, and for Jake it was the final straw. He gave up hope and thought alike, and allowed himself to descend wholly into the nightmare.

    ROLAND HALTED IN FRONT of the barricade which choked the street from side to side and top to bottom. Unlike Jake, he had no hopes of emerging into the open on the other side. The buildings lying east of this point would be sentry-occupied islands emerging from an inland sea of trash, tools, artifacts . . . and booby-traps, he had no doubt. Some of these leavings undoubtedly still remained where they had fallen five hundred or seven hundred or a thousand years ago, but Roland thought most of it had been dragged here by the Grays a piece at a time. The eastern portion of Lud had become, in effect, the castle of the Grays, and Roland was now standing outside its wall.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He walked forward slowly and saw the mouth of a passageway half-hidden behind a ragged cement boulder. There were footprints in the powdery dust—two sets, one big, one small. Roland started to get up, looked again, and squatted on his hunkers once more. Not two sets but three, the third marking the paws of a small animal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy?” Roland called softly. For a moment there was no response, and then a single soft bark came from the shadows. Roland stepped into the passageway and saw gold-ringed eyes peering at him from around the first crooked corner. Roland trotted down to the bumbler. Oy, who still didn’t like to come really close to anyone but Jake, backed up a step and then held his ground, looking anxiously up at the gunslinger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you want to help me?” Roland asked. He could feel the dry red curtain that was battle fever at the edge of his consciousness, but this was not the time for it. The time would come, but for now he must not allow himself that inexpressible relief. “Help me find Jake?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ake!” Oy barked, still watching Roland with his anxious eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go on, then. Find him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy turned away at once and ran rapidly down the alley, nose skimming the ground. Roland followed, his eyes only occasionally flicking up to glance at Oy. Mostly he kept his gaze fixed on the ancient pavement, looking for sign.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    “JESUS,” EDDIE SAID. “WHAT kind of people <i class="calibre3">are</i> these guys?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They had followed the avenue at the base of the ramp for a couple of blocks, had seen the barricade (missing Roland’s entry into the partially hidden passageway by less than a minute) which lay ahead, and had turned north onto a broad thoroughfare which reminded Eddie of Fifth Avenue. He hadn’t dared to tell Susannah that; he was still too bitterly disappointed with this stinking, littered ruin of a city to articulate anything hopeful.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fifth Avenue” led them into an area of large white stone buildings that reminded Eddie of the way Rome looked in the gladiator movies he’d watched on TV as a kid. They were austere and, for the most part, still in good shape. He was pretty sure they had been public buildings of some sort—galleries, libraries, maybe museums. One, with a big domed roof that had cracked like a granite egg, might have been an observatory, although Eddie had read someplace that astronomers liked to be <i class="calibre3">away</i> from big cities, because all the electric lights fucked up their star-gazing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There were open areas between these imposing edifices, and although the grass and flowers which had once grown there had been choked off by weeds and tangles of underbrush, the area still had a stately feel, and Eddie wondered if it had once been the center of Lud’s cultural life. Those days were long gone, of course; Eddie doubted if Gasher and his pals were very interested in ballet or chamber music.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He and Susannah had come to a major intersection from which four more broad avenues radiated outward like spokes on a wheel. At the hub of the wheel was a large paved square. Ringing it were loudspeakers on forty-foot steel posts. In the center of the square was a pedestal with the remains of a statue upon it—a mighty copper war-horse, green with verdigris, pawing its forelegs at the air. The warrior who had once ridden this charger lay off to the side on one corroded shoulder, waving what looked like a machine-gun in one hand and a sword in the other. His legs were still bowed around the shape of the horse he had once ridden, but his boots remained welded to the sides of his metal mount. GRAYS DIE! was written across the pedestal in fading orange letters.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Glancing down the radiating streets, Eddie saw more of the speaker-poles. A few had fallen over, but most still stood, and each of these had been festooned with a grisly garland of corpses. As a result, the square into which “Fifth Avenue” emptied and the streets which led away were guarded by a small army of the dead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What kind of people <i class="calibre3">are</i> they?” Eddie asked again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He didn’t expect an answer and Susannah didn’t give one . . . but she could have. She’d had insights into the past of Roland’s world before, but never one as clear and sure as this. All of her earlier insights, like those which had come to her in River Crossing, had had a haunting visionary quality, like dreams, but what came now arrived in a single flash, and it was like seeing the twisted face of a dangerous maniac illuminated by a stroke of lightning.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The speakers . . . the hanging bodies . . . the drums. She suddenly understood how they went together as clearly as she had understood that the heavy-laden wagons passing through River Crossing on their way to Jimtown had been pulled by oxen rather than mules or horses.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Never mind this trash,” she said, and her voice only quivered a little. “It’s the train we want—which way is it, d’you think?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie glanced up at the darkening sky and easily picked out the path of the Beam in the rushing clouds. He looked back down and wasn’t much surprised to see that the entrance to the street corresponding most closely to the path of the Beam was guarded by a large stone turtle. Its reptilian’ head peered out from beneath the granite lip of its shell; its deepset eyes seemed to stare curiously at them. Eddie nodded toward it and managed a small dry smile. “See the turtle of enormous girth?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah took a brief look of her own and nodded. He pushed her across the city square and into The Street of the Turtle. The corpses which lined it gave off a dry, cinnamony smell that made Eddie’s stomach clench . . . not because it was bad but because it was actually rather pleasant—the sugar-spicy aroma of something a kid would enjoy shaking onto his morning toast.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Street of the Turtle was mercifully broad, and most of the corpses hanging from the speaker-poles were little more than mummies, but Susannah saw a few which were relatively fresh, with flies still crawling busily across the blackening skin of their swollen faces and maggots still squirming out of their decaying eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And below each speaker was a little drift of bones.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There must be thousands,” Eddie said. “Men, women, and kids.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” Susannah’s calm voice sounded distant and strange to her own ears. “They’ve had a lot of time to kill. And they’ve used it to kill each other.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Bring on those wise fuckin elves!” Eddie said, and the laugh that followed sounded suspiciously like a sob. He thought he was at last beginning to fully understand what that innocuous phrase—<i class="calibre3">the world has moved on</i>—really meant. What a breadth of ignorance and evil it covered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And what a depth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The speakers were a wartime measure</i>, Susannah thought. <i class="calibre3">Of course they were. God only knows which war, or how long ago, but it must have been a doozy. The rulers of Lud used the speakers to make city-wide announcements from some central, bomb-proof location—a bunker like the one Hitler and his high command retreated to at the end of World War II</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And in her ears she could hear the voice of authority which had come rolling out of those speakers—could hear it as clearly as she had heard the creak of the wagons passing through River Crossing, as clearly as she had heard the crack of the whip above the backs of the straining oxen.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Ration centers A and D will be closed today; please proceed to centers B, C, E, and F with proper coupons.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Militia squads Nine, Ten, and Twelve report to Sendside.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Aerial bombardment is likely between the hours of eight and ten of the clock. All noncombatant residents should report to their designated shelters. Bring your gas masks. Repeat, bring your gas masks.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Announcements, yes . . . and some garbled version of the news—a propagandized, militant version George Orwell would have called doublespeak. And in between the news bulletins and the announcements, squalling military music and exhortations to respect the fallen by sending more men and women into the red throat of the abattoir.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the war had ended and silence had fallen . . . for a while. But at some point, the speakers had begun broadcasting again. How long ago? A hundred years? Fifty? Did it matter? Susannah thought not. What mattered was that when the speakers were reactivated, the only thing they broadcast was a single tape-loop . . . the loop with the drum-track on it. And the descendents of the city’s original residents had taken it for . . . what? The Voice of the Turtle? The Will of the Beam?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah found herself remembering the time she had asked her father, a quiet but deeply cynical man, if he believed there was a God in heaven who guided the course of human events. <i class="calibre3">Well, he had said, I think it’s sort of half ’n half, Odetta. I’m sure there’s a God, but I don’t think He has much if anything to do with us these days; I believe that after we killed His son, He finally got it through His head that there wasn’t nothing to be done with the sons of Adam or the daughters of Eve, and He washed His hands of us. Wise fella.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She had responded to this (which she had fully expected; she was eleven at the time, and knew the turn of her father’s mind quite well) by showing him a squib on the Community Churches page of the local newspaper. It said that Rev. Murdock of the Grace Methodist Church would that Sunday elucidate on the topic “God Speaks to Each of Us Every Day”—with a text from First Corinthians. Her father had laughed over that so hard that tears had squirted from the corners of his eyes. <i class="calibre3">Well, I guess each of us hears someone talking, he had said at last, and you can bet your bottom dollar on one thing, sweetie: each of us—including this here Reverend Murdock—hears that voice say just exactly what he wants to hear. It’s so convenient that way.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    What <i class="calibre3">these</i> people had apparently wanted to hear in the recorded drum-track was an invitation to commit ritual murder. And now, when the drums began to throb through these hundreds or thousands of speakers—a hammering back-beat which was only the percussion to a Z.Z. Top song called “Velcro Fly,” if Eddie was right—it became their signal to unlimber the hangropes and run a few folks up the nearest speaker-posts.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">How many</i>? she wondered as Eddie rolled her along in her wheelchair, its nicked and dented hard rubber tires crackling over broken glass and whispering through drifts of discarded paper. <i class="calibre3">How many have been killed over the years because some electronic circuit under the city got the hiccups? Did it start because they recognized the essential alienness of the music, which came somehow—like us, and the airplane, and some of the cars along these streets—from another world?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She didn’t know, but she knew she had come around to her father’s cynical point of view on the subject of God and the chats He might or might not have with the sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve. These people had been looking for a reason to slaughter each other, that was all, and the drums had been as good a reason as any.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She found herself thinking of the hive they had found—the misshapen hive of white bees whose honey would have poisoned them if they had been foolish enough to eat of it. Here, on this side of the Send, was another dying hive; more mutated white bees whose sting would be no less deadly for their confusion, loss, and perplexity.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">And how many more will have to die before the tape finally breaks?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As if her thoughts had caused it to happen, the speakers suddenly began to transmit the relentless, syncopated heartbeat of the drums. Eddie yelled in surprise. Susannah screamed and clapped both hands to her ears—but before she did, she could faintly hear the rest of the music: the track or tracks which had been muted decades ago when someone (probably quite by accident) had bumped the balance control, knocking it all the way to one side and burying both the guitars and the vocal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie continued to push her along The Street of the Turtle and the Path of the Beam, trying to look in all directions at once and trying not to smell the odor of putrefaction. <i class="calibre3">Thank God for the wind</i>, he thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He began to push the wheelchair faster, scanning the weedy gaps between the big white buildings for the graceful sweep of an overhead monorail track. He wanted to get out of this endless aisle of the dead. As he took yet another deep breath of that speciously sweet cinnamon smell, it seemed to him that he had never wanted anything so badly in his whole life.
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_18"><b class="calibre4">19</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE’S DAZE WAS BROKEN abruptly when Gasher grabbed him by the collar and yanked with all the force of a cruel rider braking a galloping horse. He stuck one leg out at the same time and Jake went crashing backward over it. His head connected with the pavement and for a moment all the lights went out. Gasher, no humanitarian, brought him around quickly by seizing Jake’s lower lip and yanking it upward and outward.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake screamed and bolted to a sitting position, striking out blindly with his fists. Gasher dodged the blows easily, hooked his other hand into Jake’s armpit, and yanked him to his feet. Jake stood there, rocking drunkenly back and forth. He was beyond protest now; almost beyond understanding. All he knew for sure was that every muscle in his body felt sprung and his wounded hand was howling like an animal caught in a trap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher apparently needed a breather, and this time he was slower getting his wind back. He stood bent over with his hands planted on the knees of his green trousers, panting in fast little whistling breaths. His yellow headscarf had slipped askew. His good eye glittered like a trumpery diamond. The white silk eyepatch was now wrinkled, and curds of evil-looking yellow muck oozed onto his cheek from beneath it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take a look over your head, cully, and you’ll see why I brung you up short. Get an eyeful!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake tilted his head upward, and in the depths of his shock he was not at all surprised to see a marble fountain as big as a house-trailer dangling eighty feet above them. He and Gasher were almost below it. The fountain was held suspended by two rusty cables which were mostly hidden within huge, unsteady stacks of church pews. Even in his less-than-acute state, Jake saw that these cables were more seriously frayed than the remaining hangers on the bridge had been.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “See it?” Gasher asked, grinning. He raised his left hand to his covered eye, scooped a mass of the pussy material from beneath it, and flicked it indifferently aside. “Beauty, ain’t it? Oh, the Tick-Tock Man’s a trig cove, all right, and no mistake. (Where’s those goat-fucking drums? They should have started by now—if Copperhead’s forgot em, I’ll ram a stick so far up his arse he’ll taste bark.) Now look ahead of you, my delicious little squint.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake did, and Gasher immediately clouted him so hard that he staggered backward and almost fell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not <i class="calibre3">across</i>, idiot child! <i class="calibre3">Down</i>! See them two dark cobblestones?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    After a moment, Jake did. He nodded apathetically.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yer don’t wanter step on em, for that’d bring the whole works down on your head, cully, and anybody who wanted yer after that’d have to pick yer up with a blotter. Understand?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good.” Gasher took a final deep breath and slapped Jake’s shoulder. “Go on, then, whatcher waitin for? <i class="calibre3">Hup!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake stepped over the first of the discolored stones and saw it wasn’t really a cobblestone at all but a metal plate which had been rounded to look like one. The second was just ahead of it, cunningly placed so that if an unaware intruder happened to miss the first one, he or she would almost certainly step on the <i class="calibre3">second.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Go ahead and do it, then, he thought. Why not? The gunslinger’s never going to find you in this maze, so go ahead and bring it down. It’s got to be cleaner than what Gasher and his friends have got planned for you. Quicker, too.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His dusty moccasin wavered in the air above the booby-trap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher hit him with a fist in the middle of the back, but not hard. “Thinkin about takin a ride on the handsome, are you, my little cull?” he asked. The laughing cruelty in his voice had been replaced by simple curiosity. If it was tinged with any other emotion, it wasn’t fear but amusement. “Well, go ahead, if it’s what yer mean to do, for I have my ticket already. Only be quick about it, gods blast your eyes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s foot came down beyond the trigger of the booby-trap. His decision to live a little longer was not based on any hope that Roland would find him; it was just that this was what Roland would do—go on until someone made him stop, and then a few yards farther still if he could.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    If he did it now, he could take Gasher with him, but Gasher alone wasn’t sufficient—one look was enough to make it clear that he was telling the truth when he said he was dying already. If he went on, he might have a chance to take some of the Gasherman’s friends, too—maybe even the one he called the Tick-Tock Man.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">If I’m going to ride what he calls the handsome, Jake thought, I</i>’<i class="calibre3">d just as soon go with plenty of company.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland would have understood.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h20"/>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_19"><b class="calibre4">20</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE WAS WRONG IN his assessment of the gunslinger’s ability to follow their path through the maze; Jake’s pack was only the most obvious bit of sign they left behind them, but Roland quickly realized he did not have to pause to look for sign. He only had to follow Oy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He paused at several intersecting passages nevertheless, wanting to make sure, and each time he did, Oy looked back and uttered his low, impatient bark that seemed to say, <i class="calibre3">Hurry up! Do you want to lose them?</i> After the signs he saw—a track, a thread from Jake’s shirt, a scrap of bright yellow cloth from Gasher’s scarf—had three times confirmed the bumbler’s choices, Roland simply followed Oy. He did not give up looking for sign, but he quit making stops to hunt for it. Then the drums started up, and it was the drums—plus Gasher’s nosiness about what Jake might be carrying—that saved Roland’s life that afternoon.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He skidded to a halt in his dusty boots, and his gun was in his hand before he realized what the sound was. When he did realize, he dropped the revolver back into its holster with an impatient grunt. He was about to go on again when his eye happened first on Jake’s pack . . . and then on a pair of faint, gleaming streaks in midair just to the left of it. Roland narrowed his eyes and made out two thin wires which crisscrossed at knee level not three feet in front of him. Oy, who was built low to the ground, had scurried neatly through the inverted V formed by the wires, but if not for the drums and spotting Jake’s castoff pack, Roland would have run right into them. As his eyes moved upward, tracing the not-quite-random piles of junk poised on either side of the passageway at this point, Roland’s mouth tightened. It had been a close call, and only <i class="calibre3">ka</i> had saved him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy barked impatiently.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland dropped to his belly and crawled beneath the wires, moving slowly and carefully—he was bigger than either Jake or Gasher, and he realized a really big man wouldn’t be able to get under here at all without triggering the carefully prepared avalanche. The drums pumped and thumped in his ears. <i class="calibre3">I wonder if they’ve all gone mad, he thought. If I had to listen to that every day, I think I would have.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He got to the far side of the wires, picked up the pack, and looked inside. Jake’s books and a few items of clothing were still in there, so were the treasures he had picked up along the way—a rock which gleamed with yellow flecks that looked like gold but weren’t; an arrowhead, probably the leaving of the old forest folk, which Jake had found in a grove. of trees the day after his drawing; some coins from his own world; his father’s sunglasses; a few other things which only a boy not yet in his teens could really love and understand. Things he would want back again. . . if, that was, Roland got to him before Gasher and his friends could change him, hurt him in ways that would cause him to lose interest in the innocent pursuits and curiosities of pre-adolescent boyhood.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher’s grinning face swam into Roland’s mind like the face of a demon or a djinni from a bottle: the snaggle teeth, the vacant eyes, the mandrus crawling over the cheeks and spreading beneath the stubbly lines of the jaws. <i class="calibre3">If you hurt him. . .</i> he thought, and then forced his mind away, because that line of thought was a blind alley. If Gasher hurt the boy <i class="calibre3">(Jake!</i> his mind insisted fiercely—<i class="calibre3">Not just the boy but Jake! Jake!)</i>, Roland would kill him, yes. But the act would mean nothing, for Gasher was a dead man already.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger lengthened the straps of the pack, marvelling at the clever buckles which made this possible, slipped it onto his own back, and stood up again. Oy turned to be off, but Roland called his name and the bumbler looked back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “To me, Oy.” Roland didn’t know if the bumbler could understand (or if he would obey even if he did), but it would be better—safer—if he stayed close. Where there was one booby-trap, there were apt to be more. Next time Oy might not be so lucky.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ake!” Oy barked, not moving. The bark was assertive, but Roland thought he saw more of the truth about how Oy felt in his eyes: they were dark with fear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, but it’s dangerous,” Roland said. “To me, Oy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Back the way they had come, there was a thud as something heavy fell, probably dislodged by the punishing vibration of the drums. Roland could now see speaker-poles here and there, poking out of the wreckage like strange long-necked animals.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy trotted back to him and looked up, panting.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stay close.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ake! Ake-Ake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Jake.” He began to run again, and Oy ran beside him, heeling as neatly as any dog Roland had ever seen.

    FOR EDDIE, IT WAS, as some wise man had once said, <i class="calibre3">déjà vu</i> all over again: he was running with the wheelchair, racing time. The beach had been replaced by The Street of the Turtle, but somehow everything else was the same. Oh, there <i class="calibre3">was</i> one other relevant difference: now it was a railway station (or a cradle) he was looking for, not a free-standing door.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah was sitting bolt upright with her hair blowing out behind her and Roland’s revolver in her right hand, its barrel pointed up at the cloudy, troubled sky. The drums thudded and pounded, bludgeoning them with sound. A gigantic, dish-shaped object lay in the street just ahead, and Eddie’s overstrained mind, perhaps cued by the classical buildings on either side of them, produced an image of Jove and Thor playing Frisbee. Jove throws one wide and Thor lets it fall through a cloud—what the hell, it’s Miller Time on Olympus, anyway.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Frisbees of the gods</i>, he thought, swerving Susannah between two crumbling, rusty cars, <i class="calibre3">what a concept</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He bumped the chair up on the sidewalk to get around the artifact, which looked like some sort of telecommunications dish now that he was really close to it. He was easing the wheelchair over the curb and back into the street again—the sidewalk was too littered with crap to make any real time—when the drums suddenly cut out. The echoes rolled away into a new silence, except it wasn’t really silent at all, Eddie realized. Up ahead, the arched entrance to a marble building stood at the intersection of The Street of the Turtle and another avenue. This building had been overgrown by vines and some straggly green stuff that looked like cypress beards, but it was still magnificent and somehow dignified. Beyond it, around the corner, a crowd was babbling excitedly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t stop!” Susannah snapped. “We haven’t got time to—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A hysterical shriek drilled through the babble. It was accompanied by yells of approval, and, incredibly, the sort of applause Eddie had heard in Atlantic City hotel-casinos after some lounge act had finished doing its thing. The shriek was choked into a long, dying gargle that sounded like the buzz of a cicada. Eddie felt the hair on the nape of his neck coming to attention. He glanced at the corpses hanging from the nearest speaker-pole and understood that the fun-loving Pubes of Lud were holding another public execution.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Marvellous,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre3">Now if they only had Tony Orlando and Dawn to sing “Knock Three Times,” they could all die happy.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked curiously at the stone pile on the corner. This close, the vines which overgrew it had a powerful herbal smell. That smell was eye-wateringly bitter, but he still liked it better than the cinnamon-sweet odor of the mummified corpses. The beards of greenery growing from the vines drooped in ratty sheaves, creating waterfalls of vegetation where once there had been a series of arched entrances. A figure suddenly barrelled out through one of these waterfalls and hurried toward them. It was a kid, Eddie realized, and not that many years out of diapers, judging by the size. He was wearing a weird little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, complete with ruffled white shirt and velveteen short pants. There were ribbons in his hair. Eddie felt a sudden mad urge to wave his hands above his head and scream <i class="calibre3">But-wheat say</i>, “<i class="calibre3">Lud is o-tay!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on!” the kid cried in a high, piping voice. Several sprays of the green stuff had gotten caught in his hair; he brushed absently at these with his left hand as he ran. “They’re gonna do Spankers! It’s the Spankerman’s turn to go to the land of the drums! Come on or you’ll miss the whole fakement, gods cuss it!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah was equally stunned by the child’s appearance, but as he got closer, it struck her that there was something extremely odd and awkward about the way he was brushing at the crumbles and strands of greenery which had gotten caught in his beribboned hair: he kept using just that one hand. His other had been behind his back when he ran out through the weedy waterfall, and there it remained.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">How awkward that must be!</i> she thought, and then a tape-player turned on in her mind and she heard Roland speaking at the end of the bridge. <i class="calibre3">I knew something like this could happen. . . if we’d seen the fellow earlier, while we were still beyond the range of his exploding egg. . . Damn the luck!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She levelled Roland’s gun at the child, who had leaped from the curb and was running straight for them. “<i class="calibre3">Hold it!”</i> she screamed. <i class="calibre3">“Stand still, you!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Suze, what are you <i class="calibre3">doing?”</i> Eddie yelled.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah ignored him. In a very real sense, Susannah Dean was no longer even here; it was Detta Walker in the chair now, and her eyes were glittering with feverish suspicion. <i class="calibre3">“Stop or I’ll shoot!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Little Lord Fauntleroy might have been deaf for all the effect her warning had. “Hoss it!” he shouted jubilantly. “Yer gointer miss the whole show! Spanker’s gointer—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His right hand finally began to come out from behind his back. As it did, Eddie realized they weren’t looking at a kid but at a misshapen dwarf whose childhood was many years past. The expression Eddie had at first taken for childish glee was actually a chilly mixture of hate and rage. The dwarf’s cheeks and brow were covered with the oozing, discolored patches Roland called whore’s blossoms.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah never saw his face. Her attention was fixed on the emerging right hand, and the dull green sphere it held. That was all she needed to see. Roland’s gun crashed. The dwarf was hammered backward. A shrill cry of pain and rage rose from his tiny mouth as he landed on the sidewalk. The grenade bounced out of his hand and rolled back into the same arch through which he had emerged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Detta was gone like a dream, and Susannah looked from the smoking gun to the tiny, sprawled figure on the sidewalk with surprise, horror, and dismay. “Oh, my Jesus! I shot him! Eddie, I shot him!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Grays. . . <i class="calibre3">die!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Little Lord Fauntleroy tried to scream these words defiantly, but they came out in a bubbling choke of blood that drenched the few remaining white patches on his frilly shirt. There was a muffled explosion from inside the overgrown plaza of the corner building, and the shaggy carpets of green stuff hanging in front of the arches billowed outward like flags in a brisk gale. With them came clouds of choking, acrid smoke. Eddie flung himself on top of Susannah to shield her, and felt a gritty shower of concrete fragments—all small ones, luckily—patter down on his back, his neck, and the crown of his head. There was a series of unpleasantly wet smacking sounds to his left. He opened his eyes a crack, looked in that direction, and saw Little Lord Fauntleroy’s head just coming to a stop in the gutter. The dwarf’s eyes were still open, his mouth still fixed in its final snarl.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now there were other voices, some shrieking, some yelling, all furious. Eddie rolled off Susannah’s chair—it tottered on one wheel before deciding to stay up—and stared in the direction from which the dwarf had come. A ragged mob of about twenty men and women had appeared, some coming from around the corner, others pushing through the mats of foliage which obscured the corner building’s arches, materializing from the smoke of the dwarf’s grenade like evil spirits. Most were wearing blue headscarves and all were carrying weapons—a varied (and somehow pitiful) assortment of them which included rusty swords, dull knives, and splintery clubs. Eddie saw one man defiantly waving a hammer. <i class="calibre3">Pubes</i>, Eddie thought. <i class="calibre3">We interrupted their necktie party, and they’re pissed as hell about it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A tangle of shouts—<i class="calibre3">Kill the Grays! Kill them both! They’ve done for Luster, God kill their eyes!—</i>arose from this charming group as they caught sight of Susannah in her wheelchair and Eddie, who was now crouched on one knee before it. The man in the forefront was wearing a kilt-like wrap and waving a cutlass. He brandished this wildly (he would have decapitated the heavyset woman standing close behind him, had she not ducked) and then charged. The others followed, yelling happily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland’s gun pounded its bright thunder into the windy, overcast day, and the top of the kilt-wearing Pube’s head lifted off. The sallow skin of the woman who had almost been decapitated by his cutlass was suddenly stippled with red rain and she voiced a sound of barking dismay. The others came on past the woman and the dead man, raving and wild-eyed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie!” Susannah screamed, and fired again. A man wearing a silk-lined cape and knee-boots collapsed into the street.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie groped for the Ruger and had one panicky moment when he thought he had lost it. The butt of the gun had somehow slipped down inside the waistband of his pants. He wrapped his hand around it and yanked hard. The fucking thing wouldn’t come. The sight at the end of the barrel had somehow gotten stuck in his underwear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah fired three closely spaced shots. Each found a target, but the oncoming Pubes didn’t slow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Eddie, help me!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie tore his pants open, feeling like some cut-rate version of Superman, and finally managed to free the Ruger. He hit the safety with the heel of his left palm, placed his elbow on his leg just above the knee, and began to fire. There was no need to think—no need to even aim. Roland had told them that in battle a gunslinger’s hands worked on their own, and Eddie now discovered it was true. It would have been hard for a blind man to miss at this range, anyway. Susannah had cut the numbers of the charging Pubes to no more than fifteen; Eddie went through the remainder like a storm wind in a wheatfield, dropping four in less than two seconds.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now the single face of the mob, that look of glazed and mindless eagerness, began to break apart. The man with the hammer abruptly tossed his weapon aside and ran for it, limping extravagantly on a pair of arthritis-twisted legs. He was followed by two others. The rest of them milled uncertainly in the street.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, you deucies!” a relatively young man snarled. He wore his blue scarf around his throat like a rally-racer’s ascot. He was bald except for two fluffs of frizzy red hair, one on each side of his head. To Susannah, this fellow looked like Clarabell the Clown; to Eddie he looked like Ronald McDonald; to both of them he looked like trouble: He threw a homemade spear that might have started life as a steel tableleg. It clattered harmlessly into the street to Eddie and Susannah’s right. “Come on, I say! We can get em if we all stick togeth—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sorry, guy,” Eddie murmured, and shot him in the chest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Clarabell/Ronald staggered backward, one hand going to his shirt. He stared at Eddie with huge eyes that told his tale with heartbreaking clarity: this wasn’t supposed to happen. The hand dropped heavily to the young man’s side. A single runlet of blood, incredibly bright in the gray day, slipped from the corner of his mouth. The few remaining Pubes stared at him mutely as he slipped to his knees, and one of them turned to run.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not at all,” Eddie said. “Stay put, my retarded friend, or you’re going to get a good look at the clearing where your path ends.” He raised his voice. “Drop em, boys and girls! All of em! Now!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You . . .” the dying man whispered. “You . . . gunslinger?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s right,” Eddie said. His eyes surveyed the remaining Pubes grimly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Cry your. . . pardon,” the man with the frizzy red hair gasped, and then he fell forward onto his face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Gunslingers?”</i> one of the others asked. His tone was one of dawning horror and realization.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, you’re stupid, but you ain’t deaf,” Susannah said, “and that’s somethin, anyway.” She waggled the barrel of the gun, which Eddie was quite sure was empty. For that matter, how many rounds could be left in the Ruger? He realized he didn’t have any idea how many rounds the clip held, and cursed himself for a fool . . . but had he really believed it could come to something like this? He didn’t think so. “You heard him, folks. Drop em. Recess is over.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One by one, they complied. The woman who was wearing a pint or so of Mr. Sword-and-Kilt’s blood on her face said, “You shouldn’t’ve killed Winston, missus—’twas his birthday, so it was.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, I guess he should have stayed home and eaten some more birthday cake,” Eddie said. Given the overall quality of this experience, he didn’t find either the woman’s comment or his own response at all surreal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was one other woman among the remaining Pubes, a scrawny thing whose long blonde hair was coming out in big patches, as if she had the mange. Eddie observed her sidling toward the dead dwarf—and the potential safety of the overgrown arches beyond him—and put a bullet into the cracked cement close by her foot. He had no idea what he wanted with her, but what he didn’t want was one of them giving the rest of them ideas. For one thing, he was afraid of what his hands might do if the sickly, sullen people before him tried to run. Whatever his head thought about this gunslinging business, his hands had discovered they liked it just fine.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stand where you are, beautiful. Officer Friendly says play it safe.” He glanced at Susannah and was disturbed by the grayish quality of her complexion. “Suze, you all right?” he asked in a lower voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re not going to faint or anything, are you? Because—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No.” She looked at him with eyes so dark they were like caves. “It’s just that I never shot anyone before... okay?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Well, you better get used to it</i> rose to his lips. He bit it back and returned his gaze to the five people who remained before them. They were looking at him and Susannah with a species of sullen fear which nevertheless stopped well short of terror.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Shit, most of them have forgotten what terror is</i>, he thought. <i class="calibre3">Joy, sadness, love. . . same thing</i>. <i class="calibre3">I don’t think they feel much of anything, anymore. They’ve been living in this purgatory too long.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he remembered the laughter, the excited cries, the lounge-act applause, and revised his thinking. There was at least one thing that still got their motors running, one thing that still pushed their buttons. Spanker could have testified to that.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who’s in charge here?” Eddie asked. He was watching the intersection behind the little group very carefully in case the others should get their courage back. So far he saw and heard nothing alarming from that direction. He thought that the others had probably left this ragged crew to its fate.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They looked at each other uncertainly, and finally the woman with the blood-spattered face spoke up. “Spanker was, but when the god-drums started up this time, it was Spanker’s stone what come out of the hat and we set him to dance. I guess Winston would have come next, but you did for him with your god-rotted guns, so you did.” She wiped blood deliberately from her cheek, looked at it, and then returned her sullen glance to Eddie.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, what do you think Winston was trying to do to me with his god-rotted spear?” Eddie asked. He was disgusted to find the woman had actually made him feel guilty about what he had done. “Trim my sideburns?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Killed Frank ’n Luster, too,” she went on doggedly, “and what are you? Either Grays, which is bad, or a couple of god-rotted outlanders, which is worse. Who’s left for the Pubes in City North? Topsy, I suppose—Topsy the Sailor—but he ain’t here, is he? Took his boat and went off downriver, ay, so he did, and god rot him, too, says I!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah had ceased listening; her mind had fixed with horrified fascination on something the woman had said earlier. <i class="calibre3">It was Spanker’s stone what come out of the hat and we set him to dance.</i> She remembered reading Shirley Jackson’s story “The Lottery” in college and understood that these people, the degenerate descendents of the original Pubes, were living Jackson’s nightmare. No wonder they weren’t capable of any strong emotion when they knew they would have to participate in such a grisly drawing not once a year, as in the story, but two or three times each day.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why?” she asked the bloody woman in a harsh, horrified voice. “Why do you do it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The woman looked at Susannah as if she was the world’s biggest fool. “Why? So the ghosts what live in the machines won’t take over the bodies of those who have died here—Pubes and Grays alike—and send them up through the holes in the streets to eat us. Any fool knows that.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There are no such things as ghosts,” Susannah said, and her voice sounded like so much meaningless quacking to her own ears. Of course there were. In this world, there were ghosts everywhere. Nevertheless, she pushed ahead. “What you call the god-drums is only a tape stuck in a machine. That’s really all it is.” Sudden inspiration struck her and she added: “Or maybe the Grays are doing it on purpose—did you ever think of that? They live in the other part of the city, don’t they? And under it, as well? They’ve always wanted you out. Maybe they’ve just hit on a really efficient way of getting you guys to do their work for them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bloody woman was standing next to an elderly gent wearing what looked like the world’s oldest bowler hat and a pair of frayed khaki shorts. Now he stepped forward and spoke to her with a patina of good manners that turned his underlying contempt into a dagger with razor-sharp edges. “You are quite wrong, Madam Gunslinger. There are a great many machines under Lud, and there are ghosts in all of them—demonous spirits which bear only ill will to mortal men and women. These demon-ghosts are <i class="calibre3">very</i> capable of raising the dead . . . and in Lud, there are a great many dead to raise.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Listen,” Eddie said. “Have you ever seen one of these zombies with your own eyes, Jeeves? Have <i class="calibre3">any</i> of you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jeeves curled his lip and said nothing—but that lip-curl really said it all. What else could one expect, it asked, from outlanders who used guns as a substitute for understanding?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie decided it would be best to close off the whole line of discussion. He had never been cut out for missionary work, anyway. He waggled the Ruger at the bloodstained woman. “You and your friend there—the one who looks like an English butler on his day off—are going to take us to the railroad station. After that, we can all say goodbye, and I’ll tell you the truth: that’s going to make my fuckin day.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Railroad station?” the guy who looked like Jeeves the Butler asked. “What is a railroad station?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take us to the cradle,” Susannah said. “Take us to Blaine.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This finally rattled Jeeves; an expression of shocked horror replaced the world-weary contempt with which he had thus far treated them. “You can’t go there!” he cried. “The cradle is forbidden ground, and Blaine is the most dangerous of all Lud’s ghosts!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Forbidden ground? Eddie thought. Great. If it’s the truth, at least we’ll be able to stop worrying about you assholes</i>. It was also nice to hear that there still was a Blaine . . . or that these people thought there was, anyway.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The others were staring at Eddie and Susannah with expressions of uncomprehending amazement; it was as if the interlopers had suggested to a bunch of born-again Christians that they hunt up the Ark of the Covenant and turn it into a pay toilet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie raised the Ruger until the center of Jeeves’s forehead lay in the sight. “We’re going,” he said, “and if you don’t want to join your ancestors right here and now, I suggest you stop pissing and moaning and take us there.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jeeves and the bloodstained woman exchanged an uncertain glance, but when the man in the bowler hat looked back at Eddie and Susannah, his face was firm and set. “Shoot us if you like,” he said. “We’d sooner die here than there.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You folks are a bunch of sick motherfuckers with dying on the brain!” Susannah cried at them. <i class="calibre3">“Nobody</i> has to die! Just take us where we want to go, for the love of God!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The woman said somberly, “But it <i class="calibre3">is</i> death to enter Blaine’s cradle, mum, so it is. For Blaine sleeps, and he who disturbs his rest must pay a high price.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, beautiful,” Eddie snapped. “You can’t smell the coffee with your head up your ass.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know what that means,” she said with an odd and perplexing dignity.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It means you can take us to the cradle and risk the Wrath of Blaine, or you can stand your ground here and experience the Wrath of Eddie. It doesn’t have to be a nice clean head-shot, you know. I can take you a piece at a time, and I’m feeling just mean enough to do it. I’m having a very bad day in your city—the music sucks, everybody has a bad case of b.o., and the first guy we saw threw a grenade at us and kidnapped our friend. So what do you say?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why would you go to Blaine in any case?” one of the others asked. “He stirs no more from his berth in the cradle—not for years now. He has even stopped speaking in his many voices and laughing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Speaking in his many voices and laughing?</i> Eddie thought. He looked at Susannah. She looked back and shrugged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ardis was the last to go nigh Blaine,” the blood-stained woman said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jeeves nodded somberly. “Ardis always was a fool when he were in drink. Blaine asked him some question. I heard it, but it made no sense to me—something about the mother of ravens, I think—and when Ardis couldn’t answer what was asked, Blaine slew him with blue fire.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Electricity?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jeeves and the bloodstained woman both nodded. “Ay,” the woman said. “Electricity, so it were called in the old days, so it were.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You don’t have to go in with us,” Susannah proposed suddenly. “Just get us within sight of the place. We’ll go the rest of the way on our own.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The woman looked at her mistrustfully, and then Jeeves pulled her head close to his lips and mumbled in her ear for a while. The other Pubes stood behind them in a ragged line, looking at Eddie and Susannah with the dazed eyes of people who have survived a bad air-raid.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At last the woman looked around. “Ay,” she said. “We’ll take you nigh the cradle, and then it’s good riddance to bad swill.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “My idea exactly,” Eddie said. “You and Jeeves. The rest of you, scatter.” He swept them with his eyes. “But remember this—one spear thrown from ambush, one arrow, one brick, and these two die.” This threat came out sounding so weak and pointless that Eddie wished he hadn’t made it. How could they possibly care for these two, or for any of the individual members of their clan, when they dusted two or more of them each and every day? Well, he thought, watching the others trot off without so much as a backward glance, it was too late to worry about that now.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on,” the woman said. “I want to be done with you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The feeling’s mutual,” Eddie replied,
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But before she and Jeeves led them away, the woman did something which made Eddie repent a little of his hard thoughts: knelt, brushed back the hair of the man in the kilt, and placed a kiss on his dirty cheek. “Goodbye, Winston,” she said. “Wait for me where the trees clear and the water’s sweet. I’ll come to ye, ay, as sure as dawn makes shadows run west.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I didn’t want to kill him,” Susannah said. “I want you to know that. But I wanted to die even less.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay.” The face that turned toward Susannah was stern and tearless. “But if ye mean to enter Blaine’s cradle, ye’ll die anyway. And the chances are that ye’ll die envying poor old Winston. He’s cruel, is Blaine. The cruelest of all demons in this cruel, cruel place.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, Maud,” Jeeves said, and helped her up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay. Let’s finish with them.” She surveyed Susannah and Eddie again, her eyes stern but somehow confused, as well. “Gods curse my eyes that they should ever have happened on you two in the first place. And gods curse the guns ye carry, as well, for they were always the springhead of our troubles.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">And with that attitude</i>, Susannah thought, <i class="calibre3">your troubles are going to last at least a thousand years, sugar</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Maud set a rapid pace along The Street of the Turtle. Jeeves trotted beside her. Eddie, who was pushing Susannah in the wheelchair, was soon panting and struggling to keep up. The palatial buildings which lined their way spread out until they resembled ivy-covered country houses on huge, run-to-riot lawns, and Eddie realized they had entered what had once been a very ritzy neighborhood indeed. Ahead of them, one building loomed above all others. It was a deceptively simple square construction of white stone blocks, its overhanging roof supported by many pillars. Eddie thought again of the gladiator movies he’d so enjoyed as a kid. Susannah, educated in more formal schools, was reminded of the Parthenon. Both saw and marvelled at the gorgeously sculpted bestiary—Bear and Turtle, Fish and Rat, Horse and Dog—which ringed the top of the building in two-by-two parade, and understood it was the place they had come to find.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That uneasy sensation that they were being watched by many eyes—eyes filled equally with hate and wonder—never left them. Thunder boomed as they came in sight of the monorail track; like the storm, the track came sweeping in from the south, joined The Street of the Turtle, and ran straight on toward the Cradle of Lud. And as they neared it, ancient bodies began to twist and dance in the strengthening wind on either side of them.

    AFTER THEY HAD RUN for God knew how long (all Jake knew for sure was that the drums had stopped again), Gasher once more yanked him to a stop. This time Jake managed to keep his feet. He had gotten his second wind. Gasher, who would never see eleven again, had not.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hoo! My old pump’s doing nip-ups, sweetie.”

    “Yar, you’d cry a bitter tear if I dropped dead right here, woontcher? Too likely! But no such luck, my fine young squint—old Gasher’s seen em come and seen em go, and I wasn’t born to drop dead at the feet of any little sweetcheeks berry like you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake listened to these incoherencies impassively. He meant to see Gasher dead before the day was over. Gasher might take Jake with him, but Jake no longer cared about that. He dabbed blood from his freshly split lip and looked at it thoughtfully, wondering at how quickly the desire to do murder could invade and conquer the human heart.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher observed Jake looking at his bloody fingers and grinned. “Sap’s runnin, ennet? Nor will it be the last your old pal Gasher beats out of your young tree, unless you look sharp; unless you look wery sharp indeed.” He pointed down at the cobbled surface of the narrow alley they were currently negotiating. There was a rusty manhole cover there, and Jake realized he had seen the words stamped into the steel not long ago: LaMERK FOUNDRY, they said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There’s a grip on the side,” Gasher said. “Yer see? Get your hands into that and pull away. Step lively, now, and maybe ye’ll still have all your teeth when ye meet up with Tick-Tock.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake grasped the steel cover and pulled. He pulled hard, but not quite as hard as he could have done. The maze of streets and alleys through which Gasher had run him was bad, but at least he could see. He couldn’t imagine what it might be like in the underworld below the city, where the blackness would preclude even dreams of escape, and he didn’t intend to find out unless he absolutely had to.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher quickly made it clear to him that he did.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s too heavy for—” Jake began, and then the pirate seized him by the throat and yanked him upward until they were face to face. The long run through the alleys had brought a thin, sweaty flush to his cheeks and turned the sores eating into his flesh an ugly yellow-purple color. Those which were open exuded thick infected matter and threads of blood in steady pulses. Jake caught just a whiff of Gasher’s thick stench before his wind was cut off by the hand which had encircled his throat.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Listen, you stupid cull, and listen well, for this is your last warning. You yank that fucking streethead off right now or I’ll reach into your mouth and rip the living tongue right out of it. And feel free to bite all you want while I do it, for what I have runs in the blood and you’ll see the first blossoms on yer own face before the week’s out—if yer lives that long. Now, do you see?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded frantically. Gasher’s face was disappearing into deepening folds of gray, and his voice seemed to be coming from a great distance.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right.” Gasher shoved him backward. Jake fell in a heap beside the manhole cover, gagging and retching. He finally managed to draw in a deep, whooping breath that burned like liquid fire. He spat out a blood-flecked wad of stuff and almost threw up at the sight of it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now yank back that cover, my heart’s delight, and let’s have no more natter about it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake crawled over to it, slid his hands into the grip, and this time pulled with all his might. For one terrible moment he thought he was still not going to be able to budge it. Then he imagined Gasher’s fingers reaching into his mouth and seizing his tongue, and found a little extra. There was a dull, spreading agony in his lower back as something gave there, but the circular lid slipped slowly aside, grinding on the cobbles and exposing a grinning crescent of darkness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good, cully, good!” Gasher cried cheerfully. “What a little mule y’are! Keep pulling——don’t give up now!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When the crescent had become a half-moon and the pain in Jake’s lower back was a white-hot fire, Gasher booted him in the ass, knocking him asprawl.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wery good!” Gasher said, peering in. “Now, cully, go smartly down the ladder on the side. Mind you don’t lose your grip and tumble all the way to the bottom, for those rungs are fearsome slick and greezy. There’s twenty or so, as I remember. And when you get to the bottom, stand stock-still and wait for me. You might feel like runnin from yer old pal, but do you think that would be a good idea?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” Jake said. “I suppose not.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wery intelligent, old son!” Gasher’s lips spread in his hideous smile, once more revealing his few surviving teeth. “It’s dark down there, and there are a thousand tunnels going every which-a-way. Yer old pal Gasher knows em like the back of his hand, so he does, but you’d be lost in no time. Then there’s the rats—wery big and wery hungry they are. So you just wait.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I will.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher regarded him narrowly. “You speak just like a little triggie, you do, but you’re no Pube—I’ll set my watch and warrant to that. Where are you from, squint?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake said nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Bumbler got your tongue, do he? Well, that’s all right; Tick-Tock’ll get it all out of you, so he will. He’s got a way about him, Ticky does; just naturally wants to make people conwerse. Once he gets em goin, they sometimes talks so fast and screams so loud someone has to hit em over the head to slow em down. Bumblers ain’t allowed to hold no one’s tongue around the Tick-Tock Man, not even fine young triggers like you. Now get the fuck down that ladder. <i class="calibre3">Hup!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He lashed out with his foot. This time Jake managed to tuck in and dodge the blow. He looked into the half-open manhole, saw the ladder, and started down. He was still chest-high to the alley when a tremendous stonelike crash hammered the air. It came from a mile or more away, but Jake knew what it was without having to be told. A cry of pure misery burst from his lips.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A grim smile tugged at the corners of Gasher’s mouth. “Your hardcase friend trailed ye a little better than ye thought he would, didn’t he? Not better than <i class="calibre3">I</i> thought, though, cully, for I got a look at his eyes—wery pert and cunning they were. I thought he’d come arter his juicy little night-nudge a right smart, if he was to come at all, and so he did. He spied the tripwires, but the fountain’s got him, so <i class="calibre3">that’s</i> all right. Get on, sweetcheeks.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He aimed a kick at Jake’s protruding head. Jake ducked it, but one foot slipped on the ladder bolted to the side of the sewer shaft and he only saved himself from falling by clutching Gasher’s scab-raddled ankle. He looked up, pleading, and saw no softening on that dying, infected face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Please,” he said, and heard the word trying to break into a sob. He kept seeing Roland lying crushed beneath the huge fountain. What had Gasher said? If anyone wanted him, they would have to pick him up with a blotter.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Beg if you want, dear heart. Just don’t expect no good to come of it, for mercy stops on this side of the bridge, so it does. Now go down, or I’ll kick your bleedin brains right outcher bleedin ears.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    So Jake went down, and by the time he reached the standing water at the bottom, the urge to cry had passed. He waited, shoulders slumped and head down, for Gasher to descend and lead him to his fate.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND HAD COME CLOSE to tripping the crossed wires which held back the avalanche of junk, but the dangling fountain was absurd—a trap which might have been set by a stupid child. Cort had taught them to constantly check all visual quadrants as they moved in enemy territory, and that included above as well as behind and below.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stop,” he told Oy, raising his voice to be heard over the drums.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Op!” Oy agreed, then looked ahead and immediately added, “Ake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” The gunslinger took another look up at the suspended marble fountain, then examined the street, looking for the trigger. There were two, he saw. Perhaps their camouflage as cobblestones had once been effective, but that time was long past. Roland bent down, hands on his knees, and spoke into Oy’s upturned face. “Going to pick you up for a minute now. Don’t fuss, Oy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland put his arms around the bumbler. At first Oy stiffened and attempted to pull away, and then Roland felt the small animal give in. He wasn’t happy about being this close to someone who wasn’t Jake, but he clearly intended to put up with it. Roland found himself wondering again just how intelligent Oy was.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He carried him up the narrow passage and beneath The Hanging Fountain of Lud, stepping carefully over the mock cobbles. Once they were safely past, he bent to let Oy go. As he did, the drums stopped.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ake!” Oy said impatiently. “Ake-Ake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes—but there’s a little piece of business to attend to first.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He led Oy fifteen yards farther down the alley, then bent and picked up a chunk of concrete. He tossed it thoughtfully from hand to hand, and as he did, he heard the sound of a pistol-shot from the east. The amplified thump of the drums had buried the sound of Eddie and Susannah’s battle with the ragged band of Pubes, but he heard this gunshot clearly and smiled—it almost surely meant that the Deans had reached the cradle, and that was the first good news of this day, which already seemed at least a week long.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland turned and threw the piece of concrete. His aim was as true as it had been when he had thrown at the ancient traffic signal in River Crossing; the missile struck one of the discolored triggers dead center, and one of the rusty cables snapped with a harsh twang. The marble fountain dropped, rolling over as the other cable snubbed it for a moment longer—long enough so that a man with fast reflexes could have cleared the drop-zone anyway, Roland reckoned. Then it too let go, and the fountain fell like a pink, misshapen stone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland dropped behind a pile of rusty steel beams and Oy jumped nimbly into his lap as the fountain hit the street with a vast, shattery thump. Chunks of pink marble, some as big as carts, flew through the air. Several small chips stung Roland’s face. He brushed others out of Oy’s fur. He looked over the makeshift barricade. The fountain had cracked in two like a vast plate. <i class="calibre3">We won’t be coming back this way</i>, Roland thought. The passageway, narrow to begin with, was now completely blocked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He wondered if Jake had heard the fall of the fountain, and what he had made of it if he had. He didn’t waste such speculation on Gasher; Gasher would think he had been crushed to paste, which was exactly what Roland wanted him to think. Would Jake think the same thing? The boy should know better than to believe a gunslinger could be killed by such a simple device, but if Gasher had terrorized him enough, Jake might not be thinking that clearly. Well, it was too late to worry about it now, and if he had it to do over again, he would do exactly the same thing. Dying or not, Gasher had displayed both courage and animal cunning. If he was off his guard now, the trick was worth it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland got to his feet. “Oy—find Jake.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ake!” Oy stretched his head forward on his long neck, sniffed around in a semicircle, picked up Jake’s scent, and was off again with Roland running after. Ten minutes later he came to a stop at a manhole cover in the street, sniffed all the way around it, then looked up at Roland and barked shrilly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger dropped to one knee and observed both the confusion of tracks and a wide path of scratches on the cobbles. He thought this particular manhole cover had been moved quite often. His eyes narrowed as he saw the wad of bloody phlegm in a crease between two nearby cobbles.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The bastard keeps hitting him,” he murmured.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pulled the manhole cover back, looked down, then untied the rawhide lacings which held his shirt closed. He picked the bumbler up and tucked him into his shirt. Oy bared his teeth, and for a moment Roland felt his claws splayed against the flesh of his chest and belly like small sharp knives. Then they withdrew and Oy only peered out of Roland’s shirt with his bright eyes, panting like a steam engine. The gunslinger could feel the rapid beat of Oy’s heart against his own. He pulled the rawhide lace from the eyelets in his shirt and found another, longer, lace in his purse.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m going to leash you. I don’t like it and you’re going to like it even less, but it’s going to be very dark down there.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He tied the two lengths of rawhide together and formed one end into a wide loop which he slipped over Oy’s head. He expected Oy to bare his teeth again, perhaps even to nip him, but Oy didn’t. He only looked up at Roland with his gold-ringed eyes and barked “Ake!” again in his impatient voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland put the loose end of his makeshift leash in his mouth, then sat down on the edge of the sewer shaft... if that was what it was. He felt for the top rung of the ladder and found it. He descended slowly and carefully, more aware than ever that he was missing half a hand and that the steel rungs were slimy with oil and some thicker stuff that was probably moss. Oy was a heavy, warm weight between his shirt and belly, panting steadily and harshly. The gold rings in his eyes gleamed like medallions in the dim light.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At last, the gunslinger’s groping foot splashed into the water at the bottom of the shaft. He glanced up briefly at the coin of white light far above him. <i class="calibre3">This is where it starts getting hard</i>, he thought. The tunnel was warm and dank and smelled like an ancient charnel house. Somewhere nearby, water was dripping hollowly and monotonously. Farther off, Roland could hear the rumble of machinery. He lifted a very grateful Oy out of his shirt and set him down in the shallow water running sluggishly along the sewer tunnel.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now it’s all up to you,” he murmured in the bumbler’s ear. “To Jake, Oy. To Jake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ake!” the bumbler barked, and splashed rapidly off into the darkness, swinging his head from side to side at the end of his long neck like a pendulum. Roland followed with the end of the rawhide leash wrapped around his diminished right hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    THE CRADLE—IT WAS easily big enough to have acquired proper-noun status in their minds—stood in the center of a square five times larger than the one where they had come upon the blasted statue, and when she got a really good look at it, Susannah realized how old and gray and fundamentally grungy the rest of Lud really was. The Cradle was so clean it almost hurt her eyes. No vines overgrew its sides; no graffiti daubed its blinding white walls and steps and columns. The yellow plains dust which had coated everything else was absent here. As they drew closer, Susannah saw why: streams of water coursed endlessly down the sides of the Cradle, issuing from nozzles hidden in the shadows of the copper-sheathed eaves. Interval sprays created by other hidden nozzles washed the steps, turning them into off-and-on waterfalls.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wow,” Eddie said. “It makes Grand Central look like a Greyhound station in Buttfuck, Nebraska.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What a poet you are, dear,” Susannah said dryly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The steps surrounded the entire building and rose to a great open lobby. There were no obscuring mats of vegetation here, but Eddie and Susannah found they still couldn’t get a good look inside; the shadows thrown by the overhanging roof were too deep. The Totems of the Beam marched all the way around the building, two by two, but the corners were reserved for creatures Susannah fervently hoped never to meet outside of the occasional nightmare—hideous stone dragons with scaly bodies, clutching, claw-tipped hands, and nasty peering eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie touched her shoulder and pointed higher. Susannah looked... and felt her breath come to a stop in her throat. Standing astride the peak of the roof, far above The Totems of the Beam and the dragonish gargoyles, as if given dominion over them, was a golden warrior at least sixty feet high. A battered cowboy hat was shoved back to reveal his lined and careworn brow; a bandanna hung askew on his upper chest, as if it had just been pulled down after serving long, hard duty as a dust-muffle. In one upraised fist he held a revolver; in the other, what appeared to be an olive branch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland of Gilead stood atop the Cradle of Lud, dressed in gold.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No,</i> she thought, at last remembering to breathe again. <i class="calibre3">It’s not him. . . but in another way, it is. That man was a gunslinger, and the resemblance between him, who’s probably been dead a thousand years or more, and Roland is all the truth of ka-tet you’ll ever need to know.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Thunder slammed out of the south. Lightning harried racing clouds across the sky. She wished she had more time to study both the golden statue which stood atop the Cradle and the animals which surrounded it; each of these latter appeared to have words carved upon them, and she had an idea that what was written there might be knowledge worth having. Under these circumstances, however, there was no time to spare.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A wide red strip had been painted across the pavement at the point where The Street of the Turtle emptied into The Plaza of the Cradle. Maud and the fellow Eddie called Jeeves the Butler stopped a prudent distance from the red mark.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This far and no farther,” Maud told them flatly. “You may take us to our deaths, but each man and woman owes one to the gods anyway, and I’ll die on this side of the dead-line no matter what. I’ll not dare Blaine for outlanders.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nor will I,” Jeeves said. He had taken off his dusty bowler and was holding it against his naked chest. On his face was an expression of fearful reverence. “Fine,” Susannah said. “Now scat on out of here, both of you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ye’ll backshoot us the second we turn from ye,” Jeeves said in a trembling voice. “I’ll take my watch and warrant on it, so I will.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Maud shook her head. The blood on her face had dried to a grotesque maroon stippling. “There never were a backshooting gunslinger—that much I <i class="calibre3">will</i> say.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We only have <i class="calibre3">their</i> word for it that that’s what they are.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Maud pointed to the big revolver with the worn sandalwood grip which Susannah held in her hand. Jeeves looked . . . and after a moment he stretched out his hand to the woman. When Maud took it, Susannah’s image of them as dangerous killers collapsed. They looked more like Hansel and Gretel than Bonnie and Clyde; tired, frightened, confused, and lost so long in the woods that they had grown old there. Her hate and fear of them departed. What replaced it was pity and a deep, aching sadness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fare you well, both of you,” she said softly. “Walk as you will, and with no fear of harm from me or my man here.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Maud nodded. “I believe you mean us no harm, and I forgive you for shooting Winston. But listen to me, and listen well: <i class="calibre3">stay out of the Cradle</i>. Whatever reasons you think you have for going in, they’re not good enough. To enter Blaine’s Cradle is death.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We don’t have any choice,” Eddie said, and thunder banged overhead again, as if in agreement. “Now let me tell <i class="calibre3">you</i> something. I don’t know what’s underneath Lud and what isn’t, but I do know those drums you’re so whacked out about are part of a recording—a <i class="calibre3">song</i>—that was made in the world my wife and I came from.” He looked at their uncomprehending faces and raised his arms in frustration. “Jesus Pumpkin-Pie Christ, don’t you get it? You’re killing each other over a piece of music that was never even released as a single!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah put her hand on his shoulder and murmured his name. He ignored her for the moment, his eyes flicking from Jeeves to Maud and then back to Jeeves again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You want to see monsters? Take a good look at each other, then. And when you get back to whatever funhouse it is you call home, take a good look at your friends and relatives.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You don’t understand,” Maud said. Her eyes were dark and somber. “But you will. Ay—you will.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go on, now,” Susannah said quietly. “Talk between us is no good; the words only drop dead. Just go your way and try to remember the faces of your fathers, for I think you lost sight of those faces long ago.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The two of them walked back in the direction from which they had come without another word. They did look back over their shoulders from time to time, however, and they were still holding hands: Hansel and Gretel lost in the deep dark forest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Lemme outta here,” Eddie said heavily. He made the Ruger safe, stuck it back in the waistband of his pants, and then rubbed his red eyes with the heels of his hands. “Just lemme out, that’s all I ask.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I know what you mean, handsome.” She was clearly scared, but her head had that defiant tilt he had come to recognize and love. He put his hands on her shoulders, bent down, and kissed her. He did not let either their surroundings or the oncoming storm keep him from doing a thorough job. When he pulled back at last, she was studying him with wide, dancing eyes. “Wow! What was that about?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “About how I’m in love with you,” he said, “and I guess that’s about all. Is it enough?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her eyes softened. For a moment she thought about telling him the secret she might or might not be keeping, but of course the time and place were wrong—she could no more tell him she might be pregnant now than she could pause to read the words written on the sculpted Portal Totems.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s enough, Eddie,” she said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re the best thing that ever happened to me.” His hazel eyes were totally focused on her. “It’s hard for me to say stuff like that—living with Henry made it hard, I guess—but it’s true. I think I started loving you because you were everything Roland took me away from—in New York, I mean—but it’s a lot more than that now, because I don’t want to go back anymore. Do you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She looked at the Cradle. She was terrified of what they might find in there, but all the same. . . she looked back at him. “No, I don’t want to go back. I want to spend the rest of my life going forward. As long as you’re with me, that is. It’s funny, you know, you saying you started loving me because of all the things he took you away from.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Funny how?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I started loving you because you set me free of Detta Walker.” She paused, thought, then shook her head slightly. “No—it goes further than that. I started loving you because you set me free of <i class="calibre3">both</i> those bitches. One was a foul-mouthed, cock-teasing thief, and the other was a self-righteous, pompous prig. Comes down to six of one and half a dozen of the other, as far as I’m concerned. I like Susannah Dean better than either one... and you were the one who set me free.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This time it was she who did the reaching, pressing her palm to his stubbly cheeks, drawing him down, kissing him gently. When he put a light hand on her breast, she sighed and covered it with her own.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think we better get going,” she said, “or we’re apt to be laying right here in the street. . . and getting wet, from the look.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie stared around at the silent towers, the broken windows, the vine-encrusted walls a final time. Then he nodded. “Yeah. I don’t think there’s any future in this town, anyway.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pushed her forward, and they both stiffened as the wheels of the chair passed over what Maud had called the dead-line, fearful that they would trip some ancient protective device and die together. But nothing happened. Eddie pushed her into the plaza, and as they approached the steps leading up to the Cradle, a cold, wind-driven rain began to fall.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Although neither of them knew it, the first of the great autumn storms of Mid-World had arrived.

  <div class="tx">
    ONCE THEY WERE IN the smelly darkness of the sewers, Gasher slowed the killing pace he’d maintained aboveground. Jake didn’t think it was because of the darkness; Gasher seemed to know every twist and turn of the route he was following, just as advertised. Jake believed it was because his captor was satisfied that Roland had been squashed to jelly by the deadfall trap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake himself had begun to wonder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    If Roland had spotted the tripwires—a far more subtle trap than the one which followed—was it really likely that he had missed seeing the fountain? Jake supposed it was possible, but it didn’t make much sense. Jake thought it more likely that Roland had tripped the fountain on purpose, to lull Gasher and perhaps slow him down. He didn’t believe Roland could follow them through this maze under the streets—the total darkness would defeat even the gunslinger’s tracking abilities—but it cheered his heart to think that Roland might not have died in an attempt to keep his promise.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They turned right, left, then left again. As Jake’s other senses sharpened in an attempt to compensate for his lack of sight, he had a vague perception of other tunnels around him. The muffled sounds of ancient, laboring machinery would grow loud for a moment, then fade as the stone foundations of the city drew close around them again. Drafts blew intermittently against his skin, sometimes warm, sometimes chilly. Their splashing footfalls echoed briefly as they passed the intersecting tunnels from which these stenchy breaths blew, and once Jake nearly brained himself on some metal object jutting down from the ceiling. He slapped at it with one hand and felt something that might have been a large valve-wheel. After that he waved his hands as he trotted along in an attempt to read the air ahead of him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher guided him with taps to the shoulders, as a waggoner might have guided his oxen. They moved at a good clip, trotting but not running. Gasher got enough of his breath back to first hum and then begin singing in a low, surprisingly tuneful tenor voice.
  </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There were five or six more verses along this line before Gasher quit. “Now <i class="calibre3">you</i> sing somethin, squint.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know anything,” Jake puffed. He hoped he sounded more out of breath than he actually was. He didn’t know if it would do him any good or not, but down here in the dark any edge seemed worth trying for.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher brought his elbow down in the center of Jake’s back, almost hard enough to send him sprawling into the ankle-high water running sluggishly through the tunnel they were traversing. “You <i class="calibre3">better</i> know sommat, ’less you want me to rip your everlovin spine right outcher back.” He paused, then added: “There’s haunts down here, boy. They live inside the fuckin machines, so they do. Singin keeps em off . . . don’t you know that? Now <i class="calibre3">sing</i>!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake thought hard, not wanting to earn another love-tap from Gasher, and came up with a song he’d learned in summer day camp at the age of seven or eight. He opened his mouth and began to bawl it into the darkness, listening to the echoes bounce back amid the sounds of running water, falling water, and ancient thudding machinery.
  </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher reached out, seized Jake’s ears as if they were jug-handles, and yanked him to a stop. “There’s a hole right ahead of yer,” he said. “With a voice like yours, squint, it’d be doin the world a mercy to letcher fall in, so it would, but Tick-Tock wouldn’t approve at all, so I reckon ye’re safe for a little longer.” Gasher’s hands left Jake’s ears, which burned like fire, and fastened on the back of his shirt. “Now lean forward until you feel the ladder on the t’other side. And mind you don’t slip and drag us both down!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake leaned cautiously forward, hands outstretched, terrified of falling into a pit he couldn’t see. As he groped for the ladder, he became aware of warm air—clean and almost fragrant—whooshing past his face, and a faint blush of rose-colored light from beneath him. His fingers touched a steel rung and closed over it. The bite-wounds on his left hand broke open again, and he felt warm blood running across his palm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Got it?” Gasher asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Then climb down! What are you waitin for, gods damn it!” Gasher let go of his shirt, and Jake could imagine him drawing his foot back, meaning to hurry him along with a kick in the ass. Jake stepped across the faintly glimmering gap and began to descend the ladder, using his hurt hand as little as possible. This time the rungs were clear of moss and oil, and hardly rusted at all. The shaft was very long and as Jake went down, hurrying to keep Gasher from stepping on his hands with his thick-soled boots, he found himself remembering a movie he’d once seen on TV—<i class="calibre3">Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The throb of machinery grew louder and the rosy glow grew stronger. The machines still didn’t sound right, but his ears told him these were in better shape than the ones above. And when he finally reached the bottom, he found the floor was dry. The new horizontal shaft was square, about six feet high, and sleeved with riveted stainless steel. It stretched away for as far as Jake could see in both directions, straight as a string. He knew instinctively, without even thinking about it, that this tunnel (which had to be at least seventy feet under Lud) also followed the path of the Beam. And somewhere up ahead—Jake was sure of this, although he couldn’t have said why—the train they had come looking for lay directly above it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Narrow ventilation grilles ran along the sides of the walls just below the shaft’s ceiling; it was from these that the clean, dry air was flowing. Moss dangled from some of them in blue-gray beards, but most were still clear. Below every other grille was a yellow arrow with a symbol that looked a bit like a lower-case <i class="calibre3">t</i>. The arrows pointed in the direction Jake and Gasher were heading.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The rose-colored light was coming from glass tubes which ran along the ceiling of the shaft in parallel rows. Some—about one in every three—were dark, and others sputtered fitfully, but at least half of them were still working. <i class="calibre3">Neon tubing</i>, Jake thought, amazed. <i class="calibre3">How about that?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher dropped down beside him. He saw Jake’s expression of surprise and grinned. “Nice, ennet? Cool in the summer, warm in the winter, and so much food that five hunnert men couldn’t eat it in five hunnert years. And do yer know the best part, squint? The very best part of the whole coozy fakement?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake shook his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Farkin Pubies don’t have the leastest idear the place even exists. They think there’s monsters down here. Catch a Pubie goin within twenty feet of a sewer-cap, less’n he has to!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He threw his head back and laughed heartily. Jake didn’t join in, even though a cold voice in the back of his mind told him it might be politic to do so. He didn’t join in because he knew exactly how the Pubes felt. There <i class="calibre3">were</i> monsters under the city—trolls and boggerts and ores. Hadn’t he been captured by just such a one?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher shoved him to the left. “Garn—almost there now. <i class="calibre3">Hup!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They jogged on, their footfalls chasing them in a pack of echoes. After ten or fifteen minutes of this, Jake saw a watertight hatchway about two hundred yards ahead. As they drew closer, he could see a big valve-wheel sticking out of it. A communicator box was mounted on the wall to the right.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m blown out,” Gasher gasped as they reached the door at the end of the tunnel. “Doin’s like this are too much for an inwalid like yer old pal, so they are!” He thumbed the button on the intercom and bawled: “I got im, Tick-Tock—got him as dandy as you please! Didn’t even muss ’is hair! Didn’t I tell yer I would? Trust the Gasherman, I said, for he’ll leadjer straight and true! Now open up and let us in!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He let go of the button and looked impatiently at the door. The valve-wheel didn’t turn. Instead a flat, drawling voice came out of the intercom speaker: “What’s the password?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher frowned horribly, scratched his chin with his long, dirty nails, then lifted his eyepatch and swabbed out another clot of yellow-green goo. “Tick-Tock and his passwords!” he said to Jake. He sounded worried as well as irritated. “He’s a trig cove, but that’s takin it a deal too far if you ask me, so it is.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pushed the button and yelled, “Come on, Tick-Tock! If you don’t reckergnize the sound of my voice, you need a heary-aid!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, I recognize it,” the drawling voice returned. To Jake it sounded like Jerry Reed, who played Burt Reynolds’s sidekick in <i class="calibre3">Smokey and the Bandit.</i> “But I don’t know who’s with you, do I? Or have you forgotten that the camera out there went tits-up last year? You give the password, Gasher, or you can rot out there!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher stuck a finger up his nose, extracted a chunk of snot the color of mint jelly, and squashed it into the grille of the speaker. Jake watched this childish display of ill temper in silent fascination, feeling unwelcome, hysterical laughter bubbling around inside him. Had they come all this way, through the booby-trapped mazes and lightless tunnels, to be balked here at this watertight door simply because Gasher couldn’t remember the Tick-Tock Man’s password?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher looked at him balefully, then slid his hand across his skull, peeling off his sweat-soaked yellow scarf. The skull beneath was bald, except for a few straggling tufts of black hair like porcupine quills, and deeply dented above the left temple. Gasher peered into the scarf and plucked forth a scrap of paper. “Gods bless Hoots,” he muttered. “Hoots takes care of me a right proper, he does.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He peered at the scrap, turning it this way and that, and then held it out to Jake. He kept his voice pitched low, as if the Tick-Tock Man could hear him even though the TALK button on the intercom wasn’t depressed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re a proper little gennelman, ain’t you? And the very first thing they teach a gennelman to do after he’s been larned not to eat the paste and piss in the corners is read. So read me the word on this paper, cully, for it’s gone right out of my head—so it has.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake took the paper, looked at it, then looked up at Gasher again. “What if I won’t?” he asked coolly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher was momentarily taken aback at this response ... and then he began to grin with dangerous good humor. “Why, I’ll grab yer by the throat and use yer head for a doorknocker,” he said. “I doubt if it’ll conwince old Ticky to let me in—for he’s still nervous of your hardcase friend, so he is—but it’ll do my heart a world of good to see your brains drippin off that wheel.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake considered this, the dark laughter still bubbling away inside him. The Tick-Tock Man was a trig enough cove, all right—he had known that it would be difficult to persuade Gasher, who was dying anyway, to speak the password even if Roland had taken him prisoner. What Tick-Tock hadn’t taken into account was Gasher’s defective memory.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Don’t laugh. If you do, he really will beat your brains out.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    In spite of his brave words, Gasher was watching Jake with real anxiety, and Jake realized a potentially powerful fact: Gasher might not be afraid of dying . . .but he <i class="calibre3">was</i> afraid of being humiliated.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right, Gasher,” he said calmly. “The word on this piece of paper is <i class="calibre3">bountiful.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Gimme that.” Gasher snatched the paper back, returned it to his scarf, and quickly wrapped the yellow cloth around his head again. He thumbed the intercom button. “Tick-Tock? Yer still there?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Where else would I be? The West End of the World?” The drawling voice now sounded mildly amused.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher stuck his whitish tongue out at the speaker, but his voice was ingratiating, almost servile. “The password’s bountyful, and a fine word it is, too! Now let me in, gods cuss it!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Of course,” the Tick-Tock Man said. A machine started up somewhere nearby, making Jake jump. The valve-wheel in the center of the door spun. When it stopped, Gasher seized it, yanked it outward, grabbed Jake’s arm, and propelled him over the raised lip of the door and into the strangest room he had ever seen in his life.

    ROLAND DESCENDED INTO DUSKY pink light. Oy’s bright eyes peered out from the open V of his shirt; his neck stretched to the limit of its considerable length as he sniffed at the warm air that blew through the ventilator grilles. Roland had had to depend completely on the bumbler’s nose in the dark passages above, and he had been terribly afraid the animal would lose Jake’s scent in the running water. . . but when he had heard the sound of singing—first Gasher, then Jake—echoing back through the pipes, he had relaxed a little. Oy had not led them wrong.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy had heard it, too. Up until then he had been moving slowly and cautiously, even backtracking every now and again to be sure of himself, but when he heard Jake’s voice he began to run, straining the rawhide leash. Roland was afraid he might call after Jake in his harsh voice—<i class="calibre3">Ake! Ake!</i>—but he hadn’t done so. And, just as they reached the shaft which led to the lower levels of this Dycian Maze, Roland had heard the sound of some new machine—a pump of some sort, perhaps—followed by the metallic, echoing crash of a door being slammed shut.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He reached the foot of the square tunnel and glanced briefly at the double line of lighted tubes which led off in either direction. They were lit with swamp-fire, he saw, like the sign outside the place which had belonged to Balazar in the city of New York. He looked more closely at the narrow chrome ventilation strips running along the top of each wall, and the arrows below them, then slipped the rawhide loop off Oy’s neck. Oy shook his head impatiently, clearly glad to be rid of it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’re close,” he murmured into the bumbler’s cocked ear, “and so we have to be quiet. Do you understand, Oy? Very quiet.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I-yet,” Oy replied in a hoarse whisper that would have been funny under other circumstances.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland put him down and Oy was immediately off down the tunnel, neck out, muzzle to the steel floor. Roland could hear him muttering <i class="calibre3">Ake-Ake! Ake-Ake!</i> under his breath. Roland unholstered his gun and followed him.

  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE AND SUSANNAH LOOKED up at the vastness of Blaine’s Cradle as the skies opened and the rain began to fall in torrents.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s a hell of a building, but they forgot the handicap ramps!” Eddie yelled, raising his voice to be heard over the rain and thunder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Never mind that,” Susannah said impatiently, slipping out of the wheelchair. “Let’s get up there and out of the rain.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked dubiously up the incline of steps. The risers were shallow. . . but there were a lot of them. “You sure, Suze?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Race you, white boy,” she said, and began to wriggle upward with uncanny ease, using hands, muscular forearms, and the stumps of her legs.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And she almost <i class="calibre3">did</i> beat him; Eddie had the ironmongery to contend with, and it slowed him down. Both of them were panting when they reached the top, and tendrils of steam were rising from their wet clothes. Eddie grabbed her under the arms, swung her up, and then just held her with his hands locked together in the small of her back instead of dropping her back into the chair, as he had meant to do. He felt randy and half-crazy without the slightest idea why.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Oh, give me a break, he thought. You’ve gotten this far alive; that’s what’s got your glands pumped up and ready to party.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah licked her full lower lip and wound her strong fingers into his hair. She pulled. It hurt. . . and at the same time it felt wonderful. “Told you I’d beat you, white boy,” she said in a low, husky voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Get outta here—I had you. . . by half a step.” He tried to sound less out of breath than he was and found it was impossible.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Maybe. . . but it blew you out, didn’t it?” One hand left his hair, slid downward, and squeezed gently. A smile gleamed in her eyes. “<i class="calibre3">Somethin</i> ain’t blown out, though.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Thunder rumbled across the sky. They flinched, then laughed together.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on,” he said. “This is nuts. The time’s all wrong.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She didn’t contradict him, but she squeezed him again before returning her hand to his shoulder. Eddie felt a pang of regret as he swung her back into her chair and ran her across vast flagstones and under cover of the roof. He thought he saw the same regret in Susannah’s eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When they were out of the downpour, Eddie paused and they looked back. The Plaza of the Cradle, The Street of the Turtle, and all the city beyond was rapidly disappearing into a shifting gray curtain. Eddie wasn’t a bit sorry. Lud hadn’t earned itself a place in his mental scrapbook of fond memories.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look,” Susannah murmured. She was pointing at a nearby downspout. It ended in a large, scaly fish-head that looked like a close relation to the dragon-gargoyles which decorated the corners of the Cradle. Water ran from its mouth in a silver torrent.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This isn’t just a passing shower, is it?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nope. It’s gonna rain until it gets tired of it, and then it’s gonna rain some more, just for spite. Maybe a week; maybe a month. Not that it’s gonna matter to us, if Blaine decides he doesn’t like our looks and fries us. Fire a shot to let Roland know we got here, sugar, and then we’ll have us a look around. See what we can see.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie pointed the Ruger into the gray sky, pulled the trigger, and fired the shot which Roland heard a mile or more away, as he followed Jake and Gasher through the booby-trapped maze. Eddie stood where he was a moment longer, trying to persuade himself that things might still turn out all right, that his heart was wrong in its stubborn insistence that they had seen the last of the gunslinger and the boy Jake. Then he made the automatic safe again, returned it to the waistband of his pants, and went back to Susannah. He turned her chair away from the steps and rolled her along an aisle of columns which led deeper into the building. She popped the cylinder of Roland’s gun and reloaded it as they went.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Under the roof the rain had a secret, ghostly sound and even the harsh thundercracks were muted. The columns which supported the structure were at least ten feet in diameter, and their tops were lost in the gloom. From up there in the shadows, Eddie heard the cooing conversation of pigeons.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now a sign hanging on thick chrome-silver chains swam out of the shadows:

    <div class="chabox">
      <div class="ctag">
        NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS WELCOMES YOU TO THE CRADLE OF LUD ←SOUTHEAST TRAVEL (BLAINE) NORTHWEST TRAVEL (PATRICIA) →
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now we know the name of the one that fell in the river,” Eddie said. “Patricia. They got their colors wrong, though. It’s supposed to be pink for girls and blue for boys, not the other way around.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Maybe they’re <i class="calibre3">both</i> blue.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “They’re not. Blaine’s pink.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How would you know that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked confused. “I don’t know how. . . but I do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They followed the arrow pointing toward Blaine’s berth, entering what had to be a grand concourse. Eddie didn’t have Susannah’s ability to see the past in clear, visionary flashes, but his imagination nonetheless filled this vast, pillared space with a thousand hurrying people; he heard clicking heels and murmuring voices, saw embraces of homecoming and farewell. And over everything, the speakers chanting news of a dozen different destinations.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Patricia is now boarding for Northwest Baronies. . .</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">

  <div class="tx1">
    Now there was only the pigeons.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shivered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look at the faces,” Susannah murmured. “I don’t know if they give you the willies, but they sure do me.” She was pointing to the right. High up on the wall, a series of sculpted heads seemed to push out of the marble, peering down at them from the shadows—stern men with the harsh faces of executioners who are happy in their work. Some of the faces had fallen from their places and lay in granite shards and splinters seventy or eighty feet below their peers. Those remaining were spiderwebbed with cracks and splattered with pigeon dung.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “They must have been the Supreme Court, or something,” Eddie said, uneasily scanning all those thin lips and cracked, empty eyes. “Only judges can look so smart and so completely pissed off at the same time—you’re talking to a guy who knows. There isn’t one of them who looks like he’d give a crippled crab a crutch.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘A heap of broken images, where the sun beats and the dead tree gives no shelter,’ ” Susannah murmured, and at these words Eddie felt gooseflesh waltz across the skin of his arms and chest and legs.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s that, Suze?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A poem by a man who must have seen Lud in his dreams,” she said. “Come on, Eddie. Forget them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Easier said than done.” But he began to push her again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ahead, a vast grilled barrier like a castle barbican swam out of the gloom. . . and beyond it, they caught their first glimpse of Blaine the Mono. It was pink, just as Eddie had said it would be, a delicate shade which matched the veins running through the marble pillars. Blaine flowed above the wide loading platform in a smooth, streamlined bullet shape which looked more like flesh than metal. Its surface was broken only once—by a triangular window equipped with a huge wiper. Eddie knew there would be another triangular window with another big wiper on the other side of the mono’s nose, so that if you looked at Blaine head-on, it would seem to have a face, just like Charlie the Choo-Choo. The wipers would look like slyly drooping eyelids.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    White light from the southeastern slot in the Cradle fell across Blaine in a long, distorted rectangle. To Eddie, the body of the train looked like the breaching back of some fabulous pink whale—one that was utterly silent.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wow.” His voice had fallen to a whisper. “We found it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Blaine the Mono.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is it dead, do you think? It <i class="calibre3">looks</i> dead.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s not. Sleeping, maybe, but a long way from dead.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You sure?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Were you sure it would be pink?” It wasn’t a question he had to answer, and he didn’t. The face she turned up to him was strained and badly frightened. “It’s sleeping, and you know what? I’m scared to wake it up.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, we’ll wait for the others, then.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She shook her head. “I think we better try to be ready for when they get here. . . because I’ve got an idea that they’re going to come on the run. Push me over to that box mounted on the bars. It looks like an intercom. See it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He did, and pushed her slowly toward it. It was mounted on one side of a closed gate in the center of the barrier which ran the length of the Cradle. The vertical bars of the barrier were made of what looked like stainless steel; those of the gate appeared to be ornamental iron, and their lower ends disappeared into steel-ringed holes in the floor. There was no way either of them was going to wriggle through those bars, either, Eddie saw. The gap between each set was no more than four inches. It would have been a tight squeeze even for Oy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Pigeons ruffled and cooed overhead. The left wheel of Susannah’s chair squawked monotonously. <i class="calibre3">My kingdom for an oilcan</i>, Eddie thought, and realized he was a lot more than just scared. The last time he had felt this level of terror had been on the day when he and Henry had stood on the sidewalk of Rhmehold Street in Dutch Hill, looking at the slumped ruin of The Mansion. They hadn’t gone in on that day in 1977; they had turned their backs on the haunted house and walked away, and he remembered vowing to himself that he would never, never, <i class="calibre3">ever</i> go back to that place. It was a promise he’d kept, but here he was, in another haunted house, and there was the haunter, right over there—Blaine the Mono, a long low pink shape with one window peering at him like the eye of a dangerous animal who is shamming sleep.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">He stirs no more from his berth in the Cradle. . . He has even stopped speaking in his many voices and laughing. . . Ardis was the last to go nigh Blaine . . . and when Ardis couldn’t answer what was asked, Blaine slew him with blue fire.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">If it speaks to me, I’ll probably go crazy</i>, Eddie thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The wind gusted outside, and a fine spray of rain flew in through the tall egress slot cut in the side of the building. He saw it strike Blaine’s window and bead up there.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shuddered suddenly and looked sharply around. “We’re being watched—I can feel it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I wouldn’t be at all surprised. Push me closer to the gate, Eddie. I want to get a better look at that box.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay, but don’t touch it. If it’s electrified—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If Blaine wants to cook us, he will,” Susannah said, looking through the bars at Blaine’s back. “You know it, and I do, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And because Eddie knew that was only the truth, he said nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The box looked like a combination intercom and burglar alarm. There was a speaker set into the top half, with what looked like a TALK/LISTEN button next to it. Below this were numbers arranged in a shape which made a diamond:

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="016" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00016.gif"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Under the diamond were two other buttons with words of the High Speech printed on them: COMMAND and ENTER.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah looked bewildered and doubtful. “What <i class="calibre3">is</i> this thing, do you think? It looks like a gadget in a science fiction movie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Of course it did, Eddie realized. Susannah had probably seen a home security system or two in her time—she had, after all, lived among the Manhattan rich, even if she had not been very enthusiastically accepted by them—but there was a world of difference between the electronics gear available in her when, 1963, and his own, which was 1987. <i class="calibre3">We’ve never talked much about the differences, either, he thought. I wonder what she’d think if I told her Ronald Reagan was President of the United States when Roland snatched me? Probably that I was crazy</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s a security system,” he said. Then, although his nerves and instincts screamed out against it, he forced himself to reach out with his right hand and thumb the TALK/LISTEN switch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no crackle of electricity; no deadly blue fire went racing up his arm. No sign that the thing was even still connected.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Maybe Blaine is dead. Maybe he’s dead, after all.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But he didn’t really believe that.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hello?” he said, and in his mind’s eye saw the unfortunate Ardis, screaming as he was microwaved by the blue fire dancing all over his face and body, melting his eyes and setting his hair ablaze. “Hello . . . Blaine? <i class="calibre3">Anybody</i>?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He let go of the button and waited, stiff with tension. Susannah’s hand crept into his, cold and small. There was still no answer, and Eddie—now more reluctant than ever—pushed the button again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Blaine?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He let go of the button. Waited. And when there was still no answer, a dangerous giddiness overcame him, as it often did in moments of stress and fear. When that giddiness took him, counting the cost no longer seemed to matter. <i class="calibre3">Nothing</i> mattered. It had been like that when he had outfaced Balazar’s sallow-faced contact man in Nassau, and it was like that now. And if Roland had seen him in the moment this lunatic impatience overtook him, he would have seen more than just a resemblance between Eddie and Cuthbert; he would have sworn Eddie <i class="calibre3">was</i> Cuthbert.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He jammed the button in with his thumb and began to bellow into the speaker, adopting a plummy (and completely bogus) British accent. “Hullo, Blaine! Cheerio, old fellow! This is Robin Leach, host of <i class="calibre3">Life-styles of the Rich and Brainless</i>, here to tell you that <i class="calibre3">you</i> have won six billion dollars and a new Ford Escort in the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Pigeons took flight above them in soft, startled explosions of wings. Susannah gasped. Her face wore the dismayed expression of a devout woman who has just heard her husband blaspheme in a cathedral. “Eddie, stop it! <i class="calibre3">Stop it!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie couldn’t stop it. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes glittered with a mixture of fear, hysteria, and frustrated anger. “You and your monorail girlfriend, Patricia, will spend a lux-<i class="calibre3">yoo</i>-rious month in scenic Jimtown, where you’ll drink only the finest wine and eat only the finest virgins! You—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “. . . <i class="calibre3">shhhh</i> . . . ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie broke off, looking at Susannah. He was at once sure that it had been she who had shushed him—not only because she had already tried but because she was the only other person here—and yet at the same time he knew it <i class="calibre3">hadn’t</i> been Susannah. That had been <i class="calibre3">another</i> voice: the voice of a very young and very frightened child.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Suze? Did you—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah was shaking her head and raising her hand at the same time. She pointed at the intercom box, and Eddie saw the button marked COMMAND was glowing a very faint shell-pink. It was the same color as the mono sleeping in its berth on the other side of the barrier.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Shhh . . . don’t wake him up,”</i> the child’s voice mourned. It drifted from the speaker, soft as an evening breeze.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What . . .” Eddie began. Then he shook his head, reached toward the TALK/LISTEN switch and pressed it gently. When he spoke again, it was not in the blaring Robin Leach bellow but in the almost-whisper of a conspirator. “What are you? Who are you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He released the button. He and Susannah regarded each other with the big eyes of children who now know they are sharing the house with a dangerous—perhaps psychotic—adult. How have they come by the knowledge? Why, because another child has told them, a child who has lived with the psychotic adult for a long time, hiding in corners and stealing out only when it knows the adult is asleep; a frightened child who happens to be almost invisible.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no answer. Eddie let the seconds spin out. Each one seemed long enough to read a whole novel in. He was reaching for the button again when the faint pink glow reappeared.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“I’m Little Blaine,” the</i> child’s <i class="calibre3">voice whispered. “The one he doesn’t see. The one he forgot. The one he thinks he left behind in the rooms of ruin and the halls of the dead.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie pushed the button again with a hand that had picked up an uncontrollable shake. He could hear that shake in his voice, as well. <i class="calibre3">“Who?</i> Who is the one who doesn’t see? Is it the Bear?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No—not the bear; not he. Shardik lay dead in the forest, many miles behind them; the world had moved on even since then. Eddie suddenly remembered what it had been like to lay his ear against that strange unfound door in the clearing where the bear had lived its violent half-life, that door with its somehow terrible stripes of yellow and black. It was all of a piece, he realized now; all part of some awful, decaying whole, a tattered web with the Dark Tower at its center like an incomprehensible stone spider. All of Mid-World had become one vast haunted mansion in these strange latter days; all of Mid-World had become The Drawers; all of Mid-World had become a waste land, haunting and haunted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He saw Susannah’s lips form the words of the real answer before the voice from the intercom could speak them, and those words were as obvious as the solution to a riddle once the answer is spoken.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Big Blaine,”</i> the unseen voice whispered. “<i class="calibre3">Big Blaine is the ghost in the machine</i>—<i class="calibre3">the ghost in</i> all <i class="calibre3">the machines.</i> ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah’s hand had gone to her throat and was clutching it, as if she intended to strangle herself. Her eyes were full of terror, but they were not glassy, not stunned; they were sharp with understanding. Perhaps she knew a voice like this one from her own when—the when where the integrated whole that was Susannah had been shunted aside by the warring personalities of Detta and Odetta. The childish voice had surprised her as well as him, but her agonized eyes said she was no stranger to the concept being expressed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah knew all about the madness of duality.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie we have to go,” she said. Her terror turned the words into an unpunctuated auditory smear. He could hear air whistling in her windpipe like a cold wind around a chimney. “Eddie we have to get away Eddie we have to get away Eddie—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Too late,”</i> the tiny, mourning voice said. “<i class="calibre3">He’s awake. Big Blaine is awake. He knows you are here. And he’s coming.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Suddenly lights—bright orange arc-sodiums—began to flash on in pairs above them, bathing the pillared vastness of the Cradle in a harsh glare that banished all shadows. Hundreds of pigeons darted and swooped in frightened, aimless flight, startled from their complex of interlocked nests high above.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wait!” Eddie shouted. “Please, wait!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    In his agitation he forgot to push the button, but it made no difference; Little Blaine responded anyway. <i class="calibre3">“No! I can’t let him catch me! I can’t let him kill me, too!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The light on the intercom box went dark again, but only for a moment. This time both COMMAND and ENTER lit up, and their color was not pink but the lurid dark red of a blacksmith’s forge.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “WHO ARE YOU?” a voice roared, and it came not just from the box but from every speaker in the city which still operated. The rotting bodies hanging from the poles shivered with the vibrations of that mighty voice; it seemed that even the dead would run from Blaine, if they could.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah shrank back in her chair, the heels of her hands pressed to her ears, her face long with dismay, her mouth distorted in a silent scream. Eddie felt himself shrinking toward all the fantastic, hallucinatory terrors of eleven. Had it been this voice he had feared when he and Henry stood outside The Mansion? That he had perhaps even <i class="calibre3">anticipated?</i> He didn’t know. . . but he <i class="calibre3">did</i> know how Jack in that old story must have felt when he realized that he had tried the beanstalk once too often, and awakened the giant.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “HOW DARE YOU DISTURB MY SLEEP? TELL ME NOW, OR DIE WHERE YOU STAND.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He might have frozen right there, leaving Blaine—Big Blaine—to do to them whatever it was he had done to Ardis (or something even worse); perhaps <i class="calibre3">should</i> have frozen, locked in that down-the-rabbit-hole, fairy-tale terror. It was the memory of the small voice which had spoken first that enabled him to move. It had been the voice of a terrified child, but it had tried to help them, terrified or not.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">So now you have to help yourself, he thought. You woke it up; deal with it, for Christ’s sake!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie reached out and pushed the button again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “My name is Eddie Dean. The woman with me is my wife, Susannah. We’re. . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at Susannah, who nodded and made frantic motions for him to go on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’re on a quest. We seek the Dark Tower which lies in the Path of the Beam. We’re in the company of two others, Roland of Gilead and. . . and Jake of New York. We’re from New York too. If you’re—” He paused for a moment, biting back the words <i class="calibre3">Big Blaine</i>. If he used them, he might make the intelligence behind the voice aware that they had heard another voice; a ghost inside the ghost, so to speak.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah gestured again for him to go on, using both hands.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you’re Blaine the Mono. . . well... we want you to take us.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He released the button. There was no response for what seemed like a very long time, only the agitated flutter of the disturbed pigeons from overhead. When Blaine spoke again, his voice came only from the speaker-box mounted on the gate and sounded almost human.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “DO NOT TRY MY PATIENCE. ALL THE DOORS TO THAT WHERE ARE CLOSED. GILEAD IS NO MORE, AND THOSE KNOWN AS GUNSLINGERS ARE ALL DEAD. NOW ANSWER MY QUESTION: WHO ARE YOU? THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a sizzling sound. A ray of brilliant blue-white light lanced down from the ceiling and seared a hole the size of a golf-ball in the marble floor less than five feet to the left of Susannah’s wheelchair. Smoke that smelled like the aftermath of a lightning-bolt rose lazily from it. Susannah and Eddie stared at each other in mute terror for a moment, and then Eddie lunged for the communicator-box and thumbed the button.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re wrong! We <i class="calibre3">did</i> come from New York! We came through the doors, on the beach, only a few weeks ago!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s true!” Susannah called. “I swear it is!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Silence. Beyond the long barrier, Blaine’s pink back humped smoothly. The window at the front seemed to regard them like a vapid glass eye. The wiper could have been a lid half-closed in a sly wink.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “PROVE IT,” Blaine said at last.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Christ, how do I do that?” Eddie asked Susannah.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie pushed the button again. “The Statue of Liberty! Does that ring a bell?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “GO ON,” Blaine said. Now the voice sounded almost thoughtful.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The Empire State Building! The Stock Exchange! The World Trade Center! Coney Island Red-Hots! Radio City Music Hall! The East Vil—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine cut him off . . . and now, incredibly, the voice which came from the speaker was the drawling voice of John Wayne.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “OKAY, PILGRIM. I BELIEVE YOU.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie and Susannah shared another glance, this one of confusion and relief. But when Blaine spoke again, the voice was again cold and emotionless.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ASK ME A QUESTION, EDDIE DEAN OF NEW YORK. AND IT BETTER BE A GOOD ONE.” There was a pause, and then Blaine added: “BECAUSE IF IT’S NOT, YOU AND YOUR WOMAN ARE GOING TO DIE, NO MATTER WHERE YOU CAME FROM.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah looked from the box on the gate to Eddie. “What’s it <i class="calibre3">talking</i> about?” she hissed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shook his head. “I don’t have the slightest idea.”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h28"/>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_27"><b class="calibre4">28</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    TO JAKE, THE ROOM Gasher dragged him into looked like a Minuteman missile silo which had been decorated by the inmates of a lunatic asylum: part museum, part living room, part hippie crash pad. Above him, empty space vaulted up to a rounded ceiling and below him it dropped seventy-five or a hundred feet to a similarly rounded base. Running all around the single curved wall in vertical lines were tubes of neon in alternating strokes of color: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, peach, pink. These long tubes came together in roaring rainbow knots at the bottom and top of the silo. . . if that was what it had been.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The room was about three-quarters of the way up the vast capsule-shaped space and floored with rusty iron grillework. Rugs that looked Turkish (he later learned that such rugs were actually from a barony called Kashmin) lay on the grilled floor here and there. Their corners were held down with brass-bound trunks or standing lamps or the squat legs of overstuffed chairs. If not, they would have flapped like strips of paper tied to an electric fan, because a steady warm draft rushed up from below. Another draft, this one issuing from a circular band of ventilators like the ones in the tunnel they had followed here, swirled about four or five feet above Jake’s head. On the far side of the room was a door identical to the one through which he and Gasher had entered, and Jake assumed it was a continuation of the subterranean corridor following the Path of the Beam.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There were half a dozen people in the room, four men and two women. Jake guessed that he was looking at the Gray high command—if, that was, there were enough Grays left to warrant a high command. None of them were young, but all were still in the prime of their lives. They looked at Jake as curiously as he looked at them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Sitting in the center of the room, with one massive leg thrown casually over the arm of a chair big enough to be a throne, was a man who looked like a cross between a Viking warrior and a giant from a child’s fairy-tale. His heavily muscled upper body was naked except for a silver band around one bicep, a knife-scabbard looped over one shoulder, and a strange charm about his neck. His lower body was clad in soft, tight-fitting leather breeches which were tucked into high boots. He wore a yellow scarf tied around one of these. His hair, a dirty gray-blonde, cascaded almost to the middle of his broad back; his eyes were as green and curious as the eyes of a tomcat who is old enough to be wise but not old enough to have lost that refined sense of cruelty which passes for fun in feline circles. Hung by its strap from the back of the chair was what looked like a very old machine-gun.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked more closely at the ornament on the Viking’s chest and saw that it was a coffin-shaped glass box hung on a silver chain. Inside it, a tiny gold clock-face marked the time at five minutes past three. Below the face, a tiny gold pendulum went back and forth, and despite the soft whoosh of circulating air from above and below, he could hear the tick-tock sound it made. The hands of the clock were moving faster than they should have done, and Jake was not very surprised to see that they were moving backward.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought of the crocodile in <i class="calibre3">Peter Pan</i>, the one that was always chasing after Captain Hook, and a little smile touched his lips. Gasher saw it, and raised his hand. Jake cringed away, putting his own hands to his face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man shook his finger at Gasher in an amusing schoolmarmish gesture. “Now, now . . . no need of that, Gasher,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher lowered his hand at once. His face had changed completely. Before, it had alternated between stupid rage and a species of cunning, almost existential humor. Now he only looked servile and adoring. Like the others in the room (and Jake himself), the Gasherman could not look away from Tick-Tock for long; his eyes were drawn inexorably back. And Jake could understand why. The Tick-Tock Man was the only person here who seemed wholly vital, wholly healthy, and wholly alive.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you say there’s no need, there ain’t,” Gasher said, but he favored Jake with a dark look before shifting his eyes back to the blonde giant on the throne. “Still, he’s wery pert, Ticky. Wery pert, Ticky. Wery pert indeed, so he is, and if you want my opinion, he’ll take a deal of training!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When I want your opinion, I’ll ask for it,” the Tick-Tock Man said. “Now close the door, Gash—was you bore in a barn?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A dark-haired woman laughed shrilly, a sound like the caw of a crow. Tick-Tock flicked his eyes toward her; she quieted at once and cast her eyes down to the grilled floor.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The door through which Gasher had dragged him was actually two doors. The arrangement reminded Jake of the way spaceship airlocks looked in the more intelligent science fiction movies. Gasher shut them both and turned to Tick-Tock, giving him a thumbs-up gesture. The Tick-Tock Man nodded and reached languidly up to press a button set into a piece of furniture that looked like a speaker’s podium. A pump began to cycle wheezily within the wall, and the neon tubes dimmed perceptibly. There was a faint hiss of air and the valve-wheel of the inside door spun shut. Jake supposed the one in the outer door was doing the same. This was some sort of bomb-shelter, all right; no doubt of that. When the pump died, the long neon tubes resumed their former muted brilliance.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There,” Tick-Tock said pleasantly. His eyes began to look Jake up and down. Jake had a clear and very uncomfortable sense of being expertly catalogued and filed. “All safe and sound, we are. Snug as bugs in a rug. Right, Hoots?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yar!” a tall, skinny man in a black suit replied promptly. His face was covered with some sort of rash which he scratched obsessively.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I brung him,” Gasher said. “I told yer you could trust me to do it, and didn’t I?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You did,” Tick-Tock said. “Bang on. I had some doubts about your ability to remember the password at the end, there, but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The dark-haired woman uttered another shrill caw. The Tick-Tock Man half-turned in her direction, that lazy smile dimpling the corners of his mouth, and before Jake was able to grasp what was happening—what had <i class="calibre3">already</i> happened—she was staggering backward, her eyes bulging in surprise and pain, her hands groping at some strange tumor in the middle of her chest which hadn’t been there a second before.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake realized the Tick-Tock Man had made some sort of move as he was turning, a move so quick it had been no more than a flicker. The slim white hilt which had protruded from the scabbard looped over the Tick-Tock Man’s shoulder was gone. The knife was now on the other side of the room, sticking out of the dark-haired woman’s chest. Tick-Tock had drawn and thrown with an uncanny speed Jake wasn’t sure even Roland could match. It had been like some malign magic trick.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The others watched silently as the woman staggered toward Tick-Tock, gagging harshly, her hands wrapped loosely around the hilt of the knife. Her hip bumped one of the standing lamps and the one called Hoots darted forward to catch it before it could fall. Tick-Tock himself never moved; he only went on sitting with his leg tossed over the arm of his throne, watching the woman with his lazy smile.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her foot caught beneath one of the rugs and she tumbled forward. Once more the Tick-Tock Man moved with that spooky speed, pulling back the foot which had been dangling over the arm of the chair and then driving it forward again like a piston. It buried itself in the pit of the dark-haired woman’s stomach and she went flying backward. Blood spewed from her mouth and splattered the furniture. She struck the wall, slid down it, and ended up sitting with her chin on her breastbone. To Jake she looked like a movie Mexican taking a siesta against an adobe wall. It was hard for him to believe she had gone from living to dead with such terrible speed. Neon tubes turned her hair into a haze that was half red and half blue. Her glazing eyes stared at the Tick-Tock Man with terminal amazement.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I <i class="calibre3">told</i> her about that laugh,” Tick-Tock said. His eyes shifted to the other woman, a heavyset redhead who looked like a long-haul trucker. “Didn’t I, Tilly?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay,” Tilly said at once. Her eyes were lustrous with fear and excitement, and she licked her lips obsessively. “So you did, many and many a time. I’ll set my watch and warrant on it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So you might, if you could reach up your fat ass far enough to find them,” Tick-Tock said. “Bring me my knife, Brandon, and mind you wipe that slut’s stink off it before you put it in my hand.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A short, bandy-legged man hopped to do as he had been bidden. The knife wouldn’t come free at first; it seemed caught on the unfortunate dark-haired woman’s breastbone. Brandon threw a terrified glance over his shoulder at the Tick-Tock Man and then tugged harder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock, however, appeared to have forgotten all about both Brandon and the woman who had literally laughed herself to death. His brilliant green eyes had fixed on something which interested him much more than the dead woman.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come here, cully,” he said. “I want a better look at you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher gave him a shove. Jake stumbled forward. He would have fallen if Tick-Tock’s strong hands hadn’t caught him by the shoulders. Then, when he was sure Jake had his balance again, Tick-Tock grasped the boy’s left wrist and raised it. It was Jake’s Seiko which had drawn his interest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If this here’s what I think it is, it’s an omen for sure and true,” Tick-Tock said. “Talk to me, boy—what’s this <i class="calibre3">sigul</i> you wear?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake, who hadn’t the slightest idea what a <i class="calibre3">sigul</i> was, could only hope for the best. “It’s a watch. But it doesn’t work, Mr. Tick-Tock.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Hoots chuckled at that, then clapped both hands over his mouth when the Tick-Tock Man turned to look at him. After a moment, Tick-Tock looked back at Jake, and a sunny smile replaced the frown. Looking at that smile almost made you forget that it was a dead woman and not a movie Mexican taking a siesta over there against the wall. Looking at it almost made you forget that these people were crazy, and the Tick-Tock Man was likely the craziest inmate in the whole asylum.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Watch,”</i> Tick-Tock said, nodding. “Ay, a likely enough name for such; after all, what does a person want with a timepiece but to watch it once in a while? Ay, Brandon? Ay, Tilly? Ay, Gasher?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They responded with eager affirmatives. The Tick-Tock Man favored them with his winning smile, then turned back to Jake again. Now Jake noticed that the smile, winning or not, stopped well short of the Tick-Tock Man’s green eyes. They were as they had been throughout: cool, cruel, and curious.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He reached a finger toward the Seiko, which now proclaimed the time to be ninety-one minutes past seven—A.M. <i class="calibre3">and</i> P.M.—and pulled it back just before touching the glass above the liquid crystal display. “Tell me, dear boy—is this ‘watch’ of yours boobyrigged?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Huh? Oh! No. No, it’s not boobyrigged.” Jake touched his own finger to the face of the watch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That means nothing, if it’s set to the frequency of your own body,” the Tick-Tock Man said. He spoke in the sharp, scornful tone Jake’s father used when he didn’t want people to figure out that he didn’t have the slightest idea what he was talking about. Tick-Tock glanced briefly at Brandon, and Jake saw him weigh the pros and cons of making the bowlegged man his designated toucher. Then he dismissed the notion and looked back into Jake’s eyes. “If this thing gives me a shock, my little friend, you’re going to be choking to death on your own sweetmeats in thirty seconds.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake swallowed hard but said nothing. The Tick-Tock Man reached out his finger again, and this time allowed it to settle on the face of the Seiko. The moment that it did, all the numbers went to zeros and then began to count upward again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock’s eyes had narrowed in a grimace of potential pain as he touched the face of the watch. Now their corners crinkled in the first genuine smile Jake had seen from him. He thought it was partly pleasure at his own courage but mostly simple wonder and interest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “May I have it?” he asked Jake silkily. “As a gesture of your goodwill, shall we say? I am something of a clock fancier, my dear young cully—so I am.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Be my guest.” Jake stripped the watch off his arm at once and dropped in onto the Tick-Tock Man’s large waiting palm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Talks just like a little silk-arse gennelman, don’t he?” Gasher said happily. “In the old days someone would have paid a wery high price for the return o’ such as him, Ticky, ay, so they would. Why, my father—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Your father died so blowed-out-rotten with the mandrus that not even the dogs would eat him,” the Tick-Tock Man interrupted. “Now shut up, you idiot.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At first Gasher looked furious . . . and then only abashed. He sank into a nearby chair and closed his mouth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock, meanwhile, was examining the Seiko’s expansion band with an expression of awe. He pulled it wide, let it snap back, pulled it wide again, let it snap back again. He dropped a lock of his hair into the open links, then laughed when they closed on it. At last he slipped the watch over his hand and pushed it halfway up his forearm. Jake thought this souvenir of New York looked very strange there, but said nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wonderful!” Tick-Tock exclaimed. “Where did you get it, cully?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It was a birthday present from my father and mother,” Jake said. Gasher leaned forward at this, perhaps wanting to mention the idea of ransom again. If so, the intent look on the Tick-Tock Man’s face changed his mind and he sat back without saying anything.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Was</i> it?” Tick-Tock marvelled, raising his eye-brows. He had discovered the small button which lit the face of the watch and kept pushing it, watching the light go off and on. Then he looked back at Jake, and his eyes were narrowed to bright green slits again. “Tell me something, cully—does this run on a dipolar or unipolar circuit?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Neither one,” Jake said, not knowing that his failure to say he did not know what either of these terms meant was buying him a great deal of future trouble. “It runs on a nickel-cadmium battery. At least I’m pretty sure it does. I’ve never had to replace it, and I lost the instruction folder a long time ago.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man looked at him for a long time without speaking, and Jake realized with dismay that the blonde man was trying to decide if Jake had been making fun of him. If he decided Jake <i class="calibre3">had</i> been making fun, Jake had an idea that the abuse he had suffered on the way here would seem like tickling compared to what the Tick-Tock Man might do. He suddenly wanted to divert Tick-Tock’s train of thought—wanted that more than anything in the world. He said the first thing he thought might turn the trick.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He was your grandfather, wasn’t he?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man raised his brows interrogatively. His hands returned to Jake’s shoulders, and although his grip was not tight, Jake could feel the phenomenal strength there. If Tick-Tock chose to tighten his grip and pull sharply forward, he would snap Jake’s collarbones like pencils. If he shoved, he would probably break his back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Who</i> was my grandfather, cully?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s eyes once more took in the Tick-Tock Man’s massive, nobly shaped head and broad shoulders. He remembered what Susannah had said: <i class="calibre3">Look at the size of him</i>, <i class="calibre3">Roland</i>—<i class="calibre3">they must have had to grease him to get him into the cockpit!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The man in the airplane. David Quick.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man’s eyes widened in surprise and amazement. Then he threw back his head and roared out a gust of laughter that echoed off the domed ceiling high above. The others smiled nervously. None, however, dared to laugh right out loud. . . not after what had happened to the woman with the dark hair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Whoever you are and wherever you come from, boy, you’re the triggest cove old Tick-Tock’s run into for many a year. Quick was my great-grandfather, not my grandfather, but you’re close enough—wouldn’t you say so, Gasher, my dear?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay,” Gasher said. “He’s trig, right enough, I could’ve toldjer that. But wery pert, all the same.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” the Tick-Tock Man said thoughtfully. His hands tightened on the boy’s shoulders and drew Jake closer to that smiling, handsome, lunatic face. “I can see he’s pert. It’s in his eyes. But we’ll take care of that, won’t we, Gasher?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s not Gasher he’s talking to</i>, Jake thought. <i class="calibre3">It’s me. He thinks he’s hypnotizing me . . . and maybe he is.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay,” Gasher breathed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake felt he was drowning in those wide green eyes. Although the Tick-Tock Man’s grip was still not really tight, he couldn’t get enough breath into his lungs. He summoned all of his own force in an effort to break the blonde man’s hold over him, and again spoke the first words which came to mind:
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So fell Lord Perth, and the countryside did shake with that thunder.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It acted upon Tick-Tock like a hard open-handed blow to the face. He recoiled, green eyes narrowing, his grip on Jake’s shoulders tightening painfully. “<i class="calibre3">What</i> do you say? Where did you hear that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A little bird told me,” Jake replied with calculated insolence, and the next instant he was flying across the room.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    If he had struck the curved wall headfirst, he would have been knocked cold or killed. As it happened, he struck on one hip, rebounded, and landed in a heap on the iron grillework. He shook his head groggily, looked around, and found himself face to face with the woman who was not taking a siesta. He uttered a shocked cry and crawled away on his hands and knees. Hoots kicked him in the chest, flipping him onto his back. Jake lay there gasping, looking up at the knot of rainbow colors where the neon tubes came together. A moment later, Tick-Tock’s face filled his field of vision. The man’s lips were pressed together in a hard, straight line, his cheeks flared with color, and there was fear in his eyes. The coffin-shaped glass ornament he wore around his neck dangled directly in front of Jake’s eyes, swinging gently back and forth on its silver chain, as if imitating the pendulum of the tiny grandfather clock inside.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Gasher’s right,” he said. He gathered a handful of Jake’s shirt into one fist and pulled him up. “You’re pert. But you don’t want to be pert with me, cully. You don’t <i class="calibre3">ever</i> want to be pert with me. Have you heard of people with short fuses? Well, I have no fuse at all, and there’s a thousand could testify to it if I hadn’t stilled their tongues for good. If you ever speak to me of Lord Perth again. . . ever, ever, <i class="calibre3">ever</i> . . . I’ll tear off the top of your skull and eat your brains. I’ll have none of that bad-luck story in the Cradle of the Grays. <i class="calibre3">Do you understand me?</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He shook Jake back and forth like a rag, and the boy burst into tears.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Do you?</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Y-Y-Yes!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good.” He set Jake upon his feet, where he swayed woozily back and forth, wiping at his streaming eyes and leaving smudges of dirt on his cheeks so dark they looked like mascara. “Now, my little cull, we’re going to have a question and answer session here. I’ll ask the questions and you’ll give the answers. Do you understand?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake didn’t reply. He was looking at a panel of the ventilator grille which circled the chamber.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man grabbed his nose between two of his fingers and squeezed it viciously. “<i class="calibre3">Do you understand me?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Yes!”</i> Jake cried. His eyes, now watering with pain as well as terror, returned to Tick-Tock’s face. He wanted to look back at the ventilator grille, wanted desperately to verify that what he had seen there was not simply a trick of his frightened, overloaded mind, but he didn’t dare. He was afraid someone else—Tick–Tock himself, most likely—would follow his gaze and see what he had seen.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good.” Tick-Tock pulled Jake back over to the chair by his nose, sat down, and cocked his leg over the arm again. “Let’s have a nice little chin, then. We’ll begin with your name, shall we? Just what might that be, cully?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jake Chambers.” With his nose pinched shut, his voice sounded nasal and foggy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And are you a Not-See, Jake Chambers?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment Jake wondered if this was a peculiar way of asking him if he was blind. . . but of course they could all see he wasn’t. “I don’t understand what—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock shook him back and forth by the nose. “Not-See! Not-See! You just want to stop playing with me, boy!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“I don’t understand</i>—” Jake began, and then he looked at the old machine-gun hanging from the chair and thought once more of the crashed Focke-Wulf. The pieces fell together in his mind. “No—I’m not a Nazi. I’m an American. All that ended long before I was born!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man released his hold on Jake’s nose, which immediately began to gush blood. “You could have told me that in the first place and saved yourself all sorts of pain, Jake Chambers. . . but at least now you understand how we do things around here, don’t you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay. Well enough! We’ll start with the simple questions.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s eyes drifted back to the ventilator grille. What he had seen before was still there; it hadn’t been just his imagination. Two gold-ringed eyes floated in the dark behind the chrome louvers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock slapped his face, knocking him back into Gasher, who immediately pushed him forward again. “It’s school-time, dear heart,” Gasher whispered. “Mind yer lessons, now! Mind em wery sharp!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look at me when I’m talking to you,” Tick-Tock said. “I’ll have some respect, Jake Chambers, or I’ll have your balls.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock’s green eyes gleamed dangerously. “All right <i class="calibre3">what?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake groped for the right answer, pushing away the tangle of questions and the sudden hope which had dawned in his mind. And what came was what would have served at his own Cradle of the Pubes. . . otherwise known as The Piper School. “All right, <i class="calibre3">sir</i>?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock smiled. “That’s a start, boy,” he said, and leaned forward, forearms on his thighs. “Now . . . what’s an American?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake began to talk, trying with all his might not to look toward the ventilator grille as he did so.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h29"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_28"><b class="calibre4">29</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND HOLSTERED HIS GUN, laid both hands on the valve-wheel, and tried to turn it. It wouldn’t budge. That didn’t much surprise him, but it presented serious problems.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy stood by his left boot, looking up anxiously, waiting for Roland to open the door so they could continue the journey to Jake. The gunslinger only wished it was that easy. It wouldn’t do to simply stand out here and wait for someone to leave; it might be hours or even days before one of the Grays decided to use this particular exit again. Gasher and his friends might take it into their heads to flay Jake alive while the gunslinger was waiting for it to happen.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He leaned his head against the steel but heard nothing. That didn’t surprise him, either. He had seen doors like this a long time ago—you couldn’t shoot out the locks, and you certainly couldn’t hear through them. There might be one; there might be two, facing each other, with some dead airspace in between. Somewhere, though, there would be a button which would spin the wheel in the middle of the door and release the locks. If Jake could reach that button, all might still be well.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland understood that he was not a full member of this <i class="calibre3">ka-tet;</i> he guessed that even Oy was more fully aware than he of the secret life which existed at its heart (he very much doubted that the bumbler had tracked Jake with his nose alone through those tunnels where water ran in polluted streamlets). Nevertheless, he had been able to help Jake when the boy had been trying to cross from his world to this one. He had been able to <i class="calibre3">see</i> . . . and when Jake had been trying to regain the key he had dropped, he had been able to send a message.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had to be very careful about sending messages this time. At best, the Grays would realize something was up. At worst, Jake might misinterpret what Roland tried to tell him and do something foolish.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But if he could <i class="calibre3">see</i> . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland closed his eyes and bent all his concentration toward Jake. He thought of the boy’s eyes and sent his <i class="calibre3">ka</i> out to find them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At first there was nothing, but at last an image began to form. It was a face framed by long, gray-blonde hair. Green eyes gleamed in deep sockets like firedims in a cave. Roland quickly understood that this was the Tick-Tock Man, and that he was a descendent of the man who had died in the air-carriage—interesting, but of no practical value in this situation. He tried to look beyond the Tick-Tock Man, to see the rest of the room in which Jake was being held, and the people in it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ake,” Oy whispered, as if reminding Roland that this was neither the time nor the place to take a nap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shhh,” the gunslinger said, not opening his eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But it was no good. He caught only blurs, probably because Jake’s concentration was focused so tightly on the Tick-Tock Man; everyone and everything else was little more than a series of gray-shrouded shapes on the edges of Jake’s perception.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland opened his eyes again and pounded his left fist lightly into the open palm of his right hand. He had an idea that he could push harder and see more ... but that might make the boy aware of his presence. That would be dangerous. Gasher might smell a rat, and if he didn’t the Tick-Tock Man would. He looked up at the narrow ventilator grilles, then down at Oy. He had wondered several times just how smart he was; now it looked as though he was going to find out.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland reached up with his good left hand, slipped his fingers between the horizontal slats of the ventilator grille closest to the hatchway through which Jake had been taken, and pulled. The grille popped out in a shower of rust and dried moss. The hole behind it was far too small for a man . . . but not for a billy-bumbler. He put the grille down, picked Oy up, and spoke softly into his ear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go . . . see . . . come back. Do you understand? Don’t let them see you. Just go and see and come back.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy gazed up into his face, saying nothing, not even Jake’s name. Roland had no idea if he had understood or not, but wasting time in ponderation would not help matters. He placed Oy in the ventilator shaft. The bumbler sniffed at the crumbles of dried moss, sneezed delicately, then only crouched there with the draft rippling through his long, silky fur, looking doubtfully at Roland with his strange eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go and see and come back,” Roland repeated in a whisper, and Oy disappeared into the shadows, walking silently, claws retracted, on the pads of his paws.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland drew his gun again and did the hardest thing. He waited.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy returned less than three minutes later. Roland lifted him out of the shaft and put him on the floor. Oy looked up at him with his long neck extended. “How many, Oy?” Roland asked. “How many did you see?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a long moment he thought the bumbler wouldn’t do anything except go on staring in his anxious way. Then he lifted his right paw tentatively in the air, extended the claws, and looked at it, as if trying to remember something very difficult. At last he began to tap on the steel floor.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One ... two ... three ... four. A pause. Then two more, quick and delicate, the extended claws clicking lightly on the steel: five, six. Oy paused a second time, head down, looking like a child lost in the throes of some titanic mental struggle. Then he tapped his claws one final time on the steel, looking up at Roland as he did it. “Ake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Six Grays . . . and Jake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland picked Oy up and stroked him. “Good!” he murmured into Oy’s ear. In truth, he was almost overwhelmed with surprise and gratitude. He had hoped for something, but this careful response was amazing. And he had few doubts about the accuracy of the count. “Good boy!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy! Ake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yes, Jake. Jake was the problem. Jake, to whom he had made a promise he intended to keep.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger thought deeply in his strange fashion—that combination of dry pragmatism and wild intuition which had probably come from his strange grandmother, Deidre the Mad, and had kept him alive all these years after his old companions had passed. Now he was depending on it to keep Jake alive, too.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He picked Oy up again, knowing Jake might live—<i class="calibre3">might—but</i> the bumbler was almost certainly going to die. He whispered several simple words into Oy’s cocked ear, repeating them over and over. At last he ceased speaking and returned him to the ventilator shaft. “Good boy,” he whispered. “Go on, now. Get it done. My heart goes with you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy! Art! Ake!” the bumbler whispered, and then scurried off into the darkness again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland waited for all hell to break loose.

  <div class="tx">
    <i class="calibre3">ASK ME A QUESTION, Eddie Dean of New York. And it better be a good one . . . if it’s not, you and your woman are going to die, no matter where you came from</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And, dear <i class="calibre3">God,</i> how did you respond to something like that?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The dark red light had gone out; now the pink one reappeared. “<i class="calibre3">Hurry</i>,” the faint voice of Little Blaine urged them. “<i class="calibre3">He’s worse than ever before . . . hurry or he’ll kill you!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was vaguely aware that flocks of disturbed pigeons were still swooping aimlessly through the Cradle, and that some of them had smashed headfirst into the pillars and dropped dead on the floor.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What does it want?” Susannah hissed at the speaker and the voice of Little Blaine somewhere behind it. “For God’s sake, <i class="calibre3">what does it want?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No reply. And Eddie could feel any period of grace they might have started with slipping away. He thumbed the TALK/LISTEN and spoke with frantic vivacity as the sweat trickled down his cheeks and neck.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Ask me a question.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So—Blaine! What have you been up to these last few years? I guess you haven’t been doing the old southeast run, huh? Any reason why not? Haven’t been feeling up to snuff?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No sound but the rustle and flap of the pigeons. In his mind he saw Ardis trying to scream as his cheeks melted and his tongue caught fire. He felt the hair on the nape of his neck stirring and clumping together. Fear? Or gathering electricity?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Hurry . . . he’s worse than ever before.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who built you, anyway?” Eddie asked frantically, thinking: <i class="calibre3">If I only knew what the fucking thing</i> wanted! “Want to talk about that? Was it the Grays? Nah . . . probably the Great Old Ones, right? Or . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He trailed off. Now he could feel Blaine’s silence as a physical weight on his skin, like fleshy, groping hands.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What do you <i class="calibre3">want?”</i> he shouted. “Just what in hell do you want to hear?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No answer—but the buttons on the box were glowing an angry dark red again, and Eddie knew their time was almost up. He could hear a low buzzing sound nearby—a sound like an electrical generator—and he didn’t believe that sound was just his imagination, no matter how much he wanted to think so.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Blaine!” Susannah shouted suddenly. “Blaine, do you hear me?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No answer . . . and Eddie felt the air was filling up with electricity as a bowl under a tap fills up with water. He could feel it crackling bitterly in his nose with every breath he took; could feel his fillings buzzing like angry insects.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Blaine, <i class="calibre3">I’ve</i> got a question, and it <i class="calibre3">is</i> a pretty good one! Listen!” She closed her eyes for a moment, fingers rubbing frantically at her temples, and then opened her eyes again. “‘There is a thing that . . . uh . . . that nothing is, and yet it has a name; ’tis sometimes tall and . . . and sometimes short . . .’ ”She broke off and stared at Eddie with wide, agonized eyes. “Help me! I can’t remember how the rest of it goes!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie only stared at her as if she had gone mad. What in the name of God was she talking about? Then it came to him, and it made a weirdly perfect sense, and the rest of the riddle clicked into his mind as neatly as the last two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. He swung toward the speaker again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘It joins our talks, it joins our sport, and plays at every game.’ What is it? That’s our question, Blaine—what is it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The red light illuminating the COMMAND and ENTER buttons below the diamond of numbers blinked out. There was an endless moment of silence before Blaine spoke again . . . but Eddie was aware that the feeling of electricity crawling all over his skin was diminishing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A SHADOW, OF COURSE,” the voice of Blaine responded. “AN EASY ONE . . . BUT NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The voice coming out of the speaker was animated by a thoughtful quality . . . and something else, as well. Pleasure? Longing? Eddie couldn’t quite decide, but he <i class="calibre3">did</i> know there was something in that voice that reminded him of Little Blaine. He knew something else, as well: Susannah had saved their bacon, at least for the time being. He bent down and kissed her cold, sweaty brow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “DO YOU KNOW ANY MORE RIDDLES?” Blaine asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, lots,” Susannah said at once. “Our companion, Jake, has a whole book of them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “FROM THE NEW YORK PLACE OF WHERE?” Blaine asked, and now the tone of his voice was perfectly clear, at least to Eddie. Blaine might be a machine, but Eddie had been a heroin junkie for six years, and he knew stone greed when he heard it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “From New York, right,” he said. “But Jake has been taken prisoner. A man named Gasher took him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No answer . . . and then the buttons glowed that faint, rosy pink again. “<i class="calibre3">Good so far</i>,” the voice of Little Blaine whispered. “<i class="calibre3">But you must be careful . . . he’s tricky</i> . . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The red lights reappeared at once.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “DID ONE OF YOU SPEAK?” Blaine’s voice was cold and—Eddie could have sworn it was so—suspicious.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at Susannah. Susannah looked back with the wide, frightened eyes of a little girl who has heard something unnameable moving slyly beneath the bed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I cleared my throat, Blaine,” Eddie said. He swallowed and armed sweat from his forehead. “I’m . . . shit, tell the truth and shame the devil. I’m scared to death.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “THAT IS VERY WISE OF YOU. THESE RIDDLES OF WHICH YOU SPEAK—ARE THEY STUPID? I WON’T HAVE MY PATIENCE TRIED WITH STUPID RIDDLES.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Most are smart,” Susannah said, but she looked anxiously at Eddie as she said it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YOU LIE. YOU DON’T KNOW THE QUALITY OF THESE RIDDLES AT ALL.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How can you say—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “VOICE ANALYSIS. FRICTIVE PATTERNS AND DIPHTHONG STRESS-EMPHASIS PROVIDE A RELIABLE QUOTIENT OF TRUTH/UNTRUTH. PREDICTIVE RELIABILITY IS 97 PER CENT, PLUS OR MINUS .5 PER CENT.” The voice fell silent for a moment, and when it spoke again, it did so in a menacing drawl that Eddie found very familiar. It was the voice of Humphrey Bogart. “I SHUGGEST YOU SHTICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW, SHWEETHEART. THE LAST GUY THAT TRIED SHADING THE TRUTH WITH ME WOUND UP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEND IN A PAIR OF SHEMENT COWBOY BOOTS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Christ,” Eddie said. “We walked four hundred miles or so to meet the computer version of Rich Little. How can you imitate guys like John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart, Blaine? Guys from our world?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay, you don’t want to answer that one. How about this one—if a riddle was what you wanted, why didn’t you just say so?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Again there was no answer, but Eddie discovered that he didn’t really need one. Blaine liked riddles, so he had asked <i class="calibre3">them</i> one. Susannah had solved it. Eddie guessed that if she had failed to do so, the two of them would now look like a couple of giant-economy-size charcoal briquets lying on the floor of the Cradle of Lud.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Blaine?” Susannah asked uneasily. There was no answer. “Blaine, are you still there?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES. TELL ME ANOTHER ONE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When is a door not a door?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “WHEN IT’S AJAR. YOU’LL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT IF YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE. CAN YOU DO BETTER THAN THAT?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If Roland gets here, I’m sure we can,” Susannah said. “Regardless of how good the riddles in Jake’s book may be, Roland knows hundreds—he actually studied them as a child.” Having said this, she realized she could not conceive of Roland as a child. “<i class="calibre3">Will</i> you take us, Blaine?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I MIGHT,” Blaine said, and Eddie was quite sure he heard a dim thread of cruelty running through that voice. “BUT YOU’LL HAVE TO PRIME THE PUMP TO GET ME GOING, AND MY PUMP PRIMES BACKWARD.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Meaning what?” Eddie asked, looking through the bars at the smooth pink line of Blaine’s back. But Blaine did not reply to this or any of the other questions they asked. The bright orange lights stayed on, but both Big Blaine and Little Blaine seemed to have gone into hibernation. Eddie, however, knew better. Blaine was awake. Blaine was watching them. Blaine was listening to their frictive patterns and diphthong stress-emphasis.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at Susannah.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘You’ll have to prime the pump, but my pump primes backward,’ ” he said bleakly. “It’s a riddle, isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, of course.” She looked at the triangular window, so like a half-lidded, mocking eye, and then pulled him close so she could whisper in his ear. “It’s totally insane, Eddie—schizophrenic, paranoid, probably delusional as well.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Tell me about it,” he breathed back. “What we’ve got here is a lunatic genius ghost-in-the-computer monorail that likes riddles and goes faster than the speed of sound. Welcome to the fantasy version of <i class="calibre3">One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you have any idea what the answer is?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shook his head. “You?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A little tickle, way back in my mind. False light, probably. I keep thinking about what Roland said: a good riddle is always sensible and always solvable. It’s like a magician’s trick.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Misdirection.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She nodded. “Go fire another shot, Eddie—let em know we’re still here.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah. Now if we could only be sure that they’re still there.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you think they are, Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had started away, and he spoke without stopping or looking back. “I don’t know—that’s a riddle not even Blaine could answer.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    “COULD I HAVE SOMETHING to drink?” Jake asked. His voice came out sounding furry and nasal. Both his mouth and the tissues in his abused nose were swelling up. He looked like someone who has gotten the worst of it in a nasty street-fight.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, yes,” Tick-Tock replied judiciously. “You <i class="calibre3">could</i>. I’d say you certainly <i class="calibre3">could</i>. We have lots to drink, don’t we, Copperhead?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Ay,” said a tall, bespectacled man in a white silk shirt and a pair of black silk trousers. He looked like a college professor in a turn-of-the-century <i class="calibre3">Punch</i> cartoon. “No shortage of poter-bulls here.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man, once more seated at ease in his throne-like chair, looked humorously at Jake. “We have wine, beer, ale, and, of course, good old water. Sometimes that’s all a body wants, isn’t it? Cool, clear, sparkling water. How does that sound, cully?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s throat, which was also swollen and as dry as sandpaper, prickled painfully. “Sounds good,” he whispered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s woke <i class="calibre3">my</i> thirsty up, I know that,” Tick-Tock said. His lips spread in a smile. His green eyes sparkled. “Bring me a dipper of water. . Till—I’ll be damned if I know what’s happened to my manners.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tilly stepped through the hatchway on the far side of the room—it was opposite the one through which Jake and Gasher had entered. Jake watched her go and licked his swollen lips.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now,” Tick-Tock said, returning his gaze to Jake, “you say the American city you came from—this New York—is much like Lud.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well . . . not exactly . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But you <i class="calibre3">do</i> recognize some of the machinery,” Tick-Tock pressed. “Valves and pumps and such. Not to mention the firedim tubes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. We call it neon, but it’s the same.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock reached out toward him. Jake cringed, but Tick-Tock only patted him on the shoulder. “Yes, yes; close enough.” His eyes gleamed. “<i class="calibre3">And</i> you’ve heard of computers?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sure, but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tilly returned with the dipper and timidly approached the Tick-Tock Man’s throne. He took it and held it out to Jake. When Jake reached for it, Tick-Tock pulled it back and drank himself. As Jake watched the water trickle from Tick-Tock’s mouth and roll down his naked chest, he began to shake. He couldn’t help it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man looked over the dipper at him, as if just remembering that Jake was still there. Behind him, Gasher, Copperhead, Brandon, and Hoots were grinning like schoolyard kids who have just heard an amusing dirty joke.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why, I got thinking about how thirsty <i class="calibre3">I</i> was and forgot all about <i class="calibre3">you!”</i> Tick-Tock cried. “That’s mean as hell, gods damn my eyes! But, of course, it looked so good . . . and it is good . . . cold . . . clear . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He held the dipper out to Jake. When Jake reached for it, Tick-Tock pulled it back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “First, cully, tell me what you know about dipolar computers and transitive circuits,” he said coldly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What . . .” Jake looked toward the ventilator grille, but the golden eyes were still gone. He was beginning to think he had imagined them after all. He shifted his gaze back to the Tick-Tock Man, understanding one thing clearly: he wasn’t going to get any water. He had been stupid to even dream he might. “What are dipolar computers?”
