  <div class="tx">
    IT WAS HER THIRD time with live ammunition . . . and her first time on the draw from the holster Roland had rigged for her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They had plenty of live rounds; Roland had brought back better than three hundred from the world where Eddie and Susannah Dean had lived their lives up until the time of their drawing. But having ammunition in plenty did not mean it could be wasted; quite the contrary, in fact. The gods frowned upon wastrels. Roland had been raised, first by his father and then by Cort, his greatest teacher, to believe this, and so he still believed. Those gods might not punish at once, but sooner or later the penance would have to be paid . . . and the longer the wait, the greater the weight.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At first there had been no need for live ammunition, anyway. Roland had been shooting for more years than the beautiful brown-skinned woman in the wheelchair would believe. He had corrected her at first simply by watching her aim and dry-fire at the targets he had set up. She learned fast. Both she and Eddie learned fast.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As he had suspected, both were born gunslingers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Today Roland and Susannah had come to a clearing less than a mile from the camp in the woods which had been home to them for almost two months now. The days had passed with their own sweet similarity. The gunslinger’s body healed itself while Eddie and Susannah learned the things the gunslinger had to teach them: how to shoot, to hunt, to gut and clean what they had killed; how to first stretch, then tan and cure the hides of those kills; how to use as much as it was possible to use so that no part of the animal was wasted; how to find north by Old Star or south by Old Mother; how to listen to the forest in which they now found themselves, sixty miles or more northeast of the Western Sea. Today Eddie had stayed behind, and the gunslinger was not put out of countenance by this. The lessons which are remembered the longest, Roland knew, are always the ones that are self-taught.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But what had always been the most important lesson was still most important: how to shoot and how to hit what you shot at every time. How to kill.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The edges of this clearing had been formed by dark, sweet-smelling fir trees that curved around it in a ragged semicircle. To the south, the ground broke off and dropped three hundred feet in a series of crumbling shale ledges and fractured cliffs, like a giant’s set of stairs. A clear stream ran out of the woods and across the center of the clearing, first bubbling through a deep channel in the spongy earth and friable stone, then pouring across the splintery rock floor which sloped down to the place where the land dropped away.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The water descended the steps in a series of waterfalls and made any number of pretty, wavering rainbows. Beyond the edge of the drop-off was a magnificent deep valley, choked with more firs and a few great old elm trees which refused to be crowded out. These latter towered green and lush, trees which might have been old when the land from which Roland had come was yet young; he could see no sign that the valley had ever burned, although he supposed it must have drawn lightning at some time or other. Nor would lightning have been the only danger. There had been people in this forest in some distant time; Roland had come across their leavings on several occasions over the past weeks. They were primitive artifacts, for the most part, but they included shards of pottery which could only have been cast in fire. And fire was evil stuff that delighted in escaping the hands which created it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Above this picturebook scene arched a blameless blue sky in which a few crows circled some miles off, crying in their old, rusty voices. They seemed restless, as if a storm were on the way, but Roland had sniffed the air and there was no rain in it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A boulder stood to the left of the stream. Roland had set up six chips of stone on top of it. Each one was heavily flecked with mica, and they glittered like lenses in the warm afternoon light.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Last chance,” the gunslinger said. “If that holster’s uncomfortabte—even the slightest bit—tell me now. We didn’t come here to waste ammunition.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She cocked a sardonic eye at him, and for a moment he could see Detta Walker in there. It was like hazy sunlight winking off a bar of steel. “What would you do if it was uncomfortable and I didn’t tell you? If I missed all six of those itty bitty things? Whop me upside the head like that old teacher of yours used to do?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger smiled. He had done more smiling these last five weeks than he had done in the five years which had come before them. “I can’t do that, and you know it. We were children, for one thing— children who hadn’t been through our rites of manhood yet. You may slap a child to correct him, or her, but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “In my world, whoppin the kiddies is also frowned on by the better class of people,” Susannah said dryly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shrugged. It was hard for him to imagine that sort of world—did not the Great Book say “Spare not the birch so you spoil not the child”?—but he didn’t believe Susannah was lying. “Your world has not moved on,” he said. “Many things are different there. Did I not see for myself that it is so?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I guess you did.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “In any case, you and Eddie are not children. It would be wrong for me to treat you as if you were. And if tests were needed, you both passed them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Although he did not say so, he was thinking of how it had ended on the beach, when she had blown three of the lumbering lobstrosities to hell before they could peel him and Eddie to the bone. He saw her answering smile and thought she might be remembering the same thing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So what you goan do if I shoot fo’ shit?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll look at you. I think that’s all I’ll need to do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She thought this over, then nodded. “Might be.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She tested the gunbelt again. It was slung across her bosom almost like a shoulder-holster (an arrangement Roland thought of as a docker’s clutch) and looked simple enough, but it had taken many weeks of trial and error—and a great deal of tailoring—to get it just right. The belt and the revolver which cocked its eroded sandalwood grip out of the ancient oiled holster had once been the gunslinger’s; the holster had hung on his right hip. He had spent much of the last five weeks coming to realize it was never going to hang there again. Thanks to the lobstrosities, he was strictly a lefthanded gun now.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So how is it?” he asked again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This time she laughed up at him. “Roland, this ole gunbelt’s as com’fable as it’s ever gonna be. Now do you want me to shoot or are we just going to sit and listen to crowmusic from over yonder?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He felt tension worming sharp little fingers under his skin now, and he supposed Cort had felt much the same at times like this under his gruff, bluff exterior. He wanted her to be good . . . <i class="calibre3">needed</i> her to be good. But to show how badly he wanted and needed—that could lead to disaster.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Tell me your lesson again, Susannah.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She sighed in mock exasperation . . . but as she spoke her smile faded and her dark, beautiful face became solemn. And from her lips he heard the old catechism again, made new in her mouth. He had never expected to hear these words from a woman. How natural they sounded . . . yet how strange and dangerous, as well.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‛I do not aim with my hand; she who aims with her hand has forgotten the face of her father.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‛I aim with my eye.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‛I do not shoot with my hand; she who shoots with her hand has forgotten the face of her father.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‛I shoot with my mind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‛I do not kill with my gun—’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She broke off and pointed at the mica-shiny stones on the boulder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m not going to kill anything anyhow—they’re just itty bitty <i class="calibre3">rocks.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her expression—a little haughty, a little naughty—suggested that she expected Roland to be exasperated with her, perhaps even angry. Roland, however, had been where she was now; he had not forgotten that apprentice gunslingers were fractious and high-spirited, nervy and apt to bite exactly at the wrong moment ... and he had discovered an unexpected capacity in himself. He could teach. More, he <i class="calibre3">liked</i> to teach, and he found himself wondering, from time to time, if that had been true of Cort, as well. He guessed that it had been.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now more crows began to call raucously, these from the forest behind them. Some part of Roland’s mind registered the fact that the new cries were agitated rather than merely quarrelsome; these birds sounded as if they had been scared up and away from whatever they had been feeding on. He had more important things to think about than whatever it was that had scared a bunch of crows, however, so he simply filed the information away and refocused his concentration on Susannah. To do otherwise with a ’prentice was to ask for a second, less playful bite. And who would be to blame for that? Who but the teacher? For was he not training her to bite? Training <i class="calibre3">both</i> of them to bite? Wasn’t that what a gunslinger was, when you stripped off the few stern lines of ritual and stilled the few iron grace-notes of catechism? Wasn’t he (or she) only a human hawk, trained to bite on command?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” he said. “They’re not rocks.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She raised her eyebrows a little and began to smile again. Now that she saw he wasn’t going to explode at her as he sometimes did when she was slow or fractious (or at least not <i class="calibre3">yet),</i> her eyes again took on the mocking sun-on-steel glint he associated with Detta Walker. “They ain’t?” The teasing in her voice was still good-natured, but he thought it would turn mean if he let it. She was tense, keyed up, her claws already halfway out of their sheaths.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No, they <i class="calibre3">ain’t,”</i> he said, returning her mockery. His own smile began to return, but it was hard and humorless. “Susannah, do you remember the <i class="calibre3">honk mahfahs</i>?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her smile began to fade.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The <i class="calibre3">honk mahfahs</i> in Oxford Town?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her smile was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you remember what the <i class="calibre3">honk mahfahs</i> did to you and your friends?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That wasn’t <i class="calibre3">me,”</i> she said. “That was another woman.” Her eyes had taken on a dull, sullen cast. He hated that look, but he also liked it just fine. It was the <i class="calibre3">right</i> look, the one that said the kindling was burning well and soon the bigger logs would start to catch.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. It was. Like it or not, it was Odetta Susannah Holmes, daughter of Sarah Walker Holmes. Not you as you <i class="calibre3">are,</i> but you as you <i class="calibre3">were</i>. Remember the fire-hoses, Susannah? Remember the gold teeth, how you saw them when they used the hoses on you and your friends in Oxford? How you saw them twinkle when they laughed?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She had told them these things, and many others, over many long nights as the campfire burned low. The gunslinger hadn’t understood everything, but he had listened carefully, just the same. And remembered. Pain was a tool, after all. Sometimes it was the best tool.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s wrong with you, Roland? Why you want to go recallin that trash in my mind?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now the sullen eyes glinted at him dangerously; they reminded him of Alain’s eyes when good-natured Alain was finally roused.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yonder stones are those men,” Roland said softly. “The men who locked you in a cell and left you to foul yourself. The men with the clubs and the dogs. The men who called you a nigger cunt.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pointed at them, moving his finger from left to right.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There’s the one who pinched your breast and laughed. There’s the one who said he better check and see if you had something stuffed up your ass. There’s the one who called you a chimpanzee in a five-hundred-dollar dress. That’s the one that kept running his billyclub over the spokes of your wheelchair until you thought the sound would send you mad. There’s the one who called your friend Leon <i class="calibre3">pinko-fag.</i> And the one on the end, Susannah, is Jack Mort.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There. Those stones. <i class="calibre3">Those men</i>.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She was breathing rapidly-now, her bosom rising and falling in swift little jerks beneath the gunslinger’s gunbelt with its heavy freight of bullets. Her eyes had left him; they were looking at the mica-flecked chips of stone. Behind them and at some distance, a tree splintered and fell over. More crows called in the sky. Deep in the game which was no longer a game, neither of them noticed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh yeah?” she breathed. “That so?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It is. Now say your lesson, Susannah Dean, and be true.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This time the words fell from her lips like small chunks of ice. Her right hand trembled lightly on the arm of her wheelchair like an idling engine.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I do not aim with my hand; she who aims with her hand has forgotten the face of her father.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I aim with my eye.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I do not shoot with my hand; she who shoots with her hand has forgotten the face of her father.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I shoot with my mind.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So it has ever been, Susannah Dean.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I do not kill with my gun; she who kills with her gun has forgotten the face of her father.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I kill with my heart.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Then KILL them, for your father’s sake!”</i> Roland shouted. <i class="calibre3">“KILL THEM ALL!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her right hand was a blur between the arm of the chair and the butt of Roland’s sixgun. It was out in a second, her left hand descending, fanning at the hammer in flutters almost as swift and delicate as the wing of a hummingbird. Six flat cracks pealed off across the valley, and five of the six chips of stone set atop the boulder blinked out of existence.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment neither of them spoke—did not even breathe, it seemed—as the echoes rolled back and forth, dimming. Even the crows were silent, at least for the time being.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger broke the silence with four toneless yet oddly emphatic words: “It is very well.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah looked at the gun in her hand as if she had never seen it before. A tendril of smoke rose from the barrel, perfectly straight in the windless silence. Then, slowly, she returned it to the holster below her bosom.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good, but not perfect,” she said at last. “I missed one.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Did you?” He walked over to the boulder and picked up the remaining chip of stone. He glanced at it, then tossed it to her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She caught it with her left; her right stayed near the holstered gun, he saw with approval. She shot better and more naturally than Eddie, but had not learned this particular lesson as swiftly as Eddie had done. If she had been with them during the shootout at Balazar’s nightclub, she might have. Now, Roland saw, she was at last learning that, too. She looked at the stone and saw the notch, barely a sixteenth of an inch deep, in its upper corner.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You only clipped it,” Roland said, returning to her, “but in a shooting scrape, sometimes that’s all you need. If you clip a fellow, throw his aim off ...” He paused. “Why are you looking at me that way?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You don’t know, do you? You really don’t?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. Your mind is often closed to me, Susannah.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no defensiveness in his voice, and Susannah shook her head in exasperation. The rapid turn-and-turn-about dance of her personality sometimes unnerved him; his seeming inability to say anything other than exactly what was on his mind never failed to do the same to her. He was the most <i class="calibre3">literal</i> man she had ever met.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right,” she said, “I’ll <i class="calibre3">tell</i> you why I’m looking at you that way, Roland. Because what you did was a mean trick. You said you wouldn’t slap me, <i class="calibre3">couldn’t</i> slap me, even if I cut up rough . . . but either you lied or you’re very stupid, and I <i class="calibre3">know</i> you ain’t stupid. People don’t always slap with their hands, as every man and woman of my race could testify. We have a little rhyme where I come from: ‘Sticks and stones will break my bones—’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘—yet taunts shall never wound me,’ ” Roland finished.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, that’s not exactly the way we say it, but I guess it’s close enough. It’s bullshit no matter how you say it. They don’t call what you did a tongue-lashing for nothing. Your words <i class="calibre3">hurt</i> me, Roland—are you gonna stand there and say you didn’t know they would?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She sat in her chair, looking up at him with bright, stern curiosity, and Roland thought—not for the first time—that the <i class="calibre3">honk mahfahs</i> of Susannah’s land must have been either very brave or very stupid to cross her, wheelchair or no wheelchair. And, having walked among them, he didn’t think bravery was the answer.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I did not think or care about your hurt,” he said patiently. “I saw you show your teeth and knew you meant to bite, so I put a stick in your jaws. And it worked . . . didn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her expression was now one of hurt astonishment. “You <i class="calibre3">bastard</i>!<i class="calibre3">”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Instead of replying, he took the gun from her holster, fumbled the cylinder open with the remaining two fingers on his right hand, and began to reload the chambers with his left hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Of all the high-handed, arrogant—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You <i class="calibre3">needed</i> to bite,” he said in that same patient tone. “Had you not, you would have shot all wrong—with your hand and your gun instead of your eye and mind and heart. Was that a trick? Was it arrogant? I think not. I think, Susannah, that <i class="calibre3">you</i> were the one with arrogance in her heart. I think <i class="calibre3">you</i> were the one with a mind to get up to tricks. That doesn’t distress me. Quite the opposite. A gunslinger without teeth is no gunslinger.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Damn it, I’m <i class="calibre3">not</i> a gunslinger!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He ignored that; he could afford to. If she was no gunslinger, then he was a billy-bumbler. “If we were playing a game, I might have behaved differently. But this is no game. It . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His good hand went to his forehead for a moment and paused there, fingers tented just above the left temple. The tips of the fingers, she saw, were trembling minutely.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland, what’s ailing you?” she asked quietly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The hand lowered slowly. He rolled the cylinder back into place and replaced the revolver in the holster she wore. “Nothing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes there is. I’ve seen it. Eddie has, too. It started almost as soon as we left the beach. It’s something wrong, and it’s getting worse.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There is nothing wrong,” he repeated.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She put her hands out and took his. Her anger was gone, at least for the time being. She looked earnestly up into his eyes. “Eddie and I . . . this isn’t our world, Roland. Without you, we’d die here. We’d have your guns, and we can shoot them, you’ve taught us to do that well enough, but we’d die just the same. We . . . we depend on you. So tell me what’s wrong. Let me try to help. Let <i class="calibre3">us</i> try to help.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had never been a man who understood himself deeply or cared to; the concept of self-consciousness (let alone self-analysis) was alien to him. His way was to act—to quickly consult his own interior, utterly mysterious workings, and then act. Of them all, he had been the most perfectly made, a man whose deeply romantic core was encased in a brutally simple box which consisted of instinct and pragmatism. He took one of those quick looks inside now and decided to tell her everything. There was something wrong with him, oh yes. Yes indeed. Something wrong with his mind, something as simple as his nature and as strange as the weird, wandering life into which that nature had impelled him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He opened his mouth to say <i class="calibre3">I’ll tell you what’s wrong, Susannah, and I’ll do it in just three words. I’m going insane.</i> But before he could begin, another tree fell in the forest—it went with a huge, grinding crash. This treefall was closer, and this time they were not deeply engaged in a test of wills masquerading as a lesson. Both heard it, both heard the agitated cawing of the crows which followed it, and both registered the fact that the tree had fallen close to their camp.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah had looked in the direction of the sound but now her eyes, wide and dismayed, returned to the gunslinger’s face. “Eddie!” she said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A cry rose from the deep green fastness of the woods in back of them—a vast cry of rage. Another tree went, and then another. They fell in what sounded like a hail of mortar-fire. <i class="calibre3">Dry wood</i>, the gunslinger thought. <i class="calibre3">Dead trees</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Eddie!”</i> This time she screamed it. “Whatever it is, <i class="calibre3">it’s near Eddie</i>!<i class="calibre3">”</i> Her hands flew to the wheels of her chair and began the laborious job of turning it around.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No time for that.” Roland seized her under her arms and pulled her free. He had carried her before when the going was too rough for her wheelchair—both men had—but she was still amazed by his uncanny, ruthless speed. At one moment she was in her wheelchair, an item which had been purchased in New York City’s finest medical supply house in the fall of 1962. At the next she was balanced precariously on Roland’s shoulders like a cheerleader, her muscular thighs gripping the sides of his neck, his palms over his head and pressing into the small of her back. He began to run with her, his sprung boots slapping the needle-strewn earth between the ruts left by her wheelchair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Odetta!” he cried, reverting in this moment of stress to the name by which he had first known her. “Don’t lose the gun! For your father’s sake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was sprinting between the trees now. Shadow-lace and bright chains of sun-dapple ran across them in moving mosaics as Roland lengthened his stride. They were going downhill now. Susannah raised her left hand to ward off a branch that wanted to slap her from the gunslinger’s shoulders. At the same moment she dropped her right hand to the butt of his ancient revolver, cradling it.

    HE WAS THE LARGEST creature in the forest which had once been known as the Great West Woods, and he was the oldest. Many of the huge old elms which Roland had noticed in the valley below had been little more than twigs sprouting from the ground when the bear came out of the dim unknown reaches of Out-World like a brutal, wandering king.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Once, the Old People had lived in the West Woods (it was their leavings which Roland had found from time to time during the last weeks), and they had gone in fear of the colossal, undying bear. They had tried to kill him when they first discovered they were not alone in the new territory to which they had come, but although their arrows enraged him, they did no serious damage. And he was not confused about the source of his torment, as were the other beasts of the forest—even the predatory bushcats which denned and littered in the sandhills to the west. No; he knew where the arrows came from, this bear. <i class="calibre3">Knew</i>. And for every arrow which found its mark in the flesh below his shaggy pelt, he took three, four, perhaps as many as half a dozen of the Old People. Children if he could get them; women if he could not. Their warriors he disdained, and this was the final humiliation.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eventually, as his real nature became clear to them, their efforts to kill him ceased. He was, of course, a demon incarnate—or the shadow of a god. They called him Mir, which to these people meant “the world beneath the world.” He stood seventy feet high, and after eighteen or more centuries of undisputed rule in the West Woods, he was dying. Perhaps the instrument of his death had at first been a microscopic organism in something he had eaten or drunk; perhaps it was old age; more likely a combination of both. The cause didn’t matter; the ultimate result—a rapidly multiplying colony of parasites foraging within his fabulous brain—did. After years of calculating, brutal sanity, Mir had run mad.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear had known men were in his woods again; he ruled the forest and although it was vast, nothing of importance which happened there escaped his attention for long. He had drawn away from the newcomers, not because he was afraid but because he had no business with them, nor they with him. Then the parasites had begun their work, and as his madness increased he became sure that it was the Old People again, that the trap-setters and forest-burners had returned and would soon set about their old, stupid mischief once more. Only as he lay in his final den some thirty miles from the place of the newcomers, sicker with each day’s dawning than he had been at sunset the night before, had he come to believe that the Old People had finally found some mischief which worked: poison.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He came this time not to take revenge for some petty wound but to stamp them out entirely before their poison could finish having its way with him . . . and as he travelled, all thought ceased. What was left was red rage, the rusty buzz of the thing on top of his head—the turning thing between his ears which had once done its work in smooth silence—and an eerily enhanced sense of smell which led him unerringly toward the camp of the three pilgrims.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear, whose real name was not Mir but something else entirely, made his way through the forest like a moving building, a shaggy tower with reddish-brown eyes. Those eyes glowed with fever and madness. His huge head, now wearing a garland of broken branches and fir-needles, swung ceaselessly from side to side. Every now and then he would sneeze in a muffled explosion of sound—<i class="calibre3">AH-CHOW!</i>—and clouds of squirming white parasites would be discharged from his dripping nostrils. His paws, armed with curved talons three feet in length, tore at the trees. He walked upright, sinking deep tracks in the soft black soil under the trees. He reeked of fresh balsam and old, sour shit.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The thing on top of his head whirred and squealed, squealed and whirred.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The course of the bear remained almost constant: a straight line which would lead him to the camp of those who had dared return to his forest, who had dared fill his head with dark green agony. Old People or New People, they would die. When he came to a dead tree, he sometimes left the straight path long enough to push it down. The dry, explosive roar of its fall pleased him; when the tree had finally collapsed its rotten length on the forest floor or come to rest against one of its mates, the bear would push on through slanting bars of sunlight turned misty with floating motes of sawdust.

  <div class="tx">
    TWO DAYS BEFORE, EDDIE Dean had begun carving again—the first time he’d tried to carve anything since the age of twelve. He remembered that he had enjoyed doing it, and he believed he must have been good at it, as well. He couldn’t remember that part, not for sure, but there was at least one clear indication that it was so: Henry, his older brother, had hated to see him doing it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Oh lookit the sissy</i>, Henry would say. <i class="calibre3">Whatcha makin today, sissy? A dollhouse? A pisspot for your itty-bitty teeny peenie? Ohhh . . . ain’t that CUTE?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Henry would never come right out and tell Eddie not to do something; would never just walk up to him and say<i class="calibre3">, Would you mind quitting that, bro? See, it’s pretty good, and when you do something that’s pretty good, it makes me nervous. Because, you see, I’m the one that’s supposed to be pretty good at stuff around here. Me. Henry Dean. So what I think I’ll do, brother o’ mine, is just sort of rag on you about certain things. I won’t come right out and say “Don’t do that, it’s makin me nervous,” because that might make me sound, you know, a little fucked up in the head. But I can rag on you, because that’s part of what big brothers do, right? All part of the image. I’ll rag on you and tease you and make fun of you until you just . . . fucking ... QUIT IT! Okay?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Well, it <i class="calibre3">wasn’t</i> okay, not really, but in the Dean household, things usually went the way Henry wanted them to go. And until very recently, that had seemed right—not okay but <i class="calibre3">right</i>. There was a small but crucial difference there, if you could but dig it. There were two reasons why it seemed right. One was an on-top reason; the other was an underneath reason.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The on-top reason was because Henry had to Watch Out for Eddie when Mrs. Dean was at work. He had to Watch Out all the time, because once there had been a Dean <i class="calibre3">sister</i>, if you could but dig it. She would have been four years older than Eddie and four years younger than Henry if she had lived, but that was the thing, you see, because she <i class="calibre3">hadn’t</i> lived. She had been run over by a drunk driver when Eddie was two. She had been watching a game of hopscotch on the sidewalk when it happened.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As a kid, Eddie had sometimes thought of his sister while listening to Mel Allen doing the play-by-play on The Yankee Baseball Network. Someone would really pound one and Mel would bellow, “<i class="calibre3">Holy cow, he got all of that one! SEEYA LATER!”</i> Well, the drunk had gotten all of Gloria Dean, holy cow, seeya later. Gloria was now in that great upper deck in the sky, and it had not happened because she was unlucky or because the State of New York had decided not to jerk the jerk’s license after his third OUI or even because God had bent down to pick up a peanut; it had happened (as Mrs. Dean frequently told her sons) because there had been no one around to Watch Out for Gloria.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Henry’s job was to make sure nothing like that ever happened to Eddie. That was his job and he did it, but it wasn’t easy. Henry and Mrs. Dean agreed on that, if nothing else. Both of them frequently reminded Eddie of just how much Henry had sacrificed to keep Eddie safe from drunk drivers and muggers and junkies and possibly even malevolent aliens who might be cruising around in the general vicinity of the upper deck, aliens who might decide to come down from their UFOs on nuclear-powered jet-skis at any time in order to kidnap little kids like Eddie Dean. So it was wrong to make Henry more nervous than this terrible responsibility had already made him. If Eddie was doing something that <i class="calibre3">did</i> make Henry more nervous, Eddie ought to cease doing that thing immediately. It was a way of paying Henry back for all the time Henry had spent Watching Out for Eddie. When you thought about it that way, you saw that doing things better than Henry could do them was very unfair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then there was the underneath reason. That reason (the world beneath the world, one might say) was more powerful, because it could never be stated: Eddie could not allow himself to be better than Henry at much of anything, because Henry was, for the most part, good for nothing . . . except Watching Out for Eddie, of course.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Henry taught Eddie how to play basketball in the playground near the apartment building where they lived—this was in a cement suburb where the towers of Manhattan stood against the horizon like a dream and the welfare check was king. Eddie was eight years younger than Henry and much smaller, but he was also much faster. He had a natural feel for the game; once he got on the cracked, hilly cement of the court with the ball in his hands, the moves seemed to sizzle in his nerve-endings. He was faster, but that was no big deal. The big deal was this: he was <i class="calibre3">better</i> than Henry. If he hadn’t known it from the results of the pick-up games in which they sometimes played, he would have known it from Henry’s thunderous looks and the hard punches to the upper arm Henry often dealt out on their way home afterwards. These punches were supposedly Henry’s little jokes—“Two for flinching!” Henry would cry cheerily, and then <i class="calibre3">whap-whap!</i> into Eddie’s bicep with one knuckle extended—but they didn’t feel like jokes. They felt like warnings. They felt like Henry’s way of saying <i class="calibre3">You better not fake me out and make me look stupid when you drive for the basket, bro; you better remember that I’m Watching Out for You.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The same was true with reading . . . baseball . . . Ring-a-Levio . . . math . . . even jump-rope, which was a girl’s game. That he was better at these things, or <i class="calibre3">could</i> be better, was a secret that had to be kept at all costs. Because Eddie was the younger brother. Because Henry was Watching Out for him. But the most important part of the underneath reason was also the simplest: these things had to be kept secret because Henry was Eddie’s big brother, and Eddie adored him.

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_3"><b class="calibre4">4</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    Two DAYS AGO, WHILE Susannah was skinning out a rabbit and Roland was starting supper, Eddie had been in the forest just south of camp. He had seen a funny spur of wood jutting out of a fresh stump. A weird feeling—he supposed it was the one people called <i class="calibre3">déjà vu</i>—swept over him, and he found himself staring fixedly at the spur, which looked like a badly shaped doorknob. He was distantly aware that his mouth had gone dry.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    After several seconds, he realized he was <i class="calibre3">looking</i> at the spur sticking out of the stump but <i class="calibre3">thinking</i> about the courtyard behind the building where he and Henry had lived—thinking about the feel of the warm cement under his ass and the whopping smells of garbage from the dumpster around the corner in the alley. In this memory he had a chunk of wood in his left hand and a paring knife from the drawer by the sink in his right. The chunk of wood jutting from the stump had called up the memory of that brief period when he had fallen violently in love with wood-carving. It was just that the memory was buried so deep he hadn’t realized, at first, what it was.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    What he had loved most about carving was the seeing part, which happened even before you began. Sometimes you saw a car or a truck. Sometimes a dog or cat. Once, he remembered, it had been the face of an idol—one of the spooky Easter Island monoliths he had seen in an issue of <i class="calibre3">National Geographic</i> at school. That had turned out to be a good one. The game was to find out how much of that thing you could get out of the wood without breaking it. You could never get it all, but if you were very careful, you could sometimes get quite a lot.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was something inside the boss on the side of the stump. He thought he might be able to release quite a lot of it with Roland’s knife—it was the sharpest, handiest tool he had ever used.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Something inside the wood, waiting patiently for someone—someone like him!—to come along and let it out. To set it free.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Oh lookit the sissy! Whatcha makin today, sissy? A dollhouse? A pisspot for your itty-bitty teeny peenie? A slingshot, so you can pretend to hunt rabbits, just like the big boys? A w w w w . . . ain’t that CUTE?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He felt a burst of shame, a sense of wrongness; that strong sense of secrets that must be kept at any cost, and then he remembered—again—that Henry Dean, who had in his later years become the great sage and eminent junkie, was dead. This realization had still not lost its power to surprise; it kept hitting him in different ways, sometimes with sorrow, sometimes with guilt, sometimes with anger. On this day, two days before the great bear came charging out of the green corridors of the woods, it had hit him in the most surprising way of all. He had felt relief, and a soaring joy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was free.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had borrowed Roland’s knife. He used it to cut carefully around the jutting boss of wood, then brought it back and sat beneath a tree with it, turning it this way and that. He was not looking <i class="calibre3">at</i> it; he was looking <i class="calibre3">into</i> it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah had finished with her rabbit. The meat went into the pot over the fire; the skin she stretched between two sticks, tying it with hanks of rawhide from Roland’s purse. Later on, after the evening meal, Eddie would begin scraping it clean. She used her hands and arms, slipping effortlessly over to where Eddie was sitting with his back propped against the tall old pine. At the campfire, Roland was crumbling some arcane—and no doubt delicious—woods-herb into the pot. “What’s doing, Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had found himself restraining an absurd urge to hide the boss of wood behind his back. “Nothing,” he said. “Thought I might, you know, carve something.” He paused, then added: “I’m not very good, though.” He sounded as if he might be trying to reassure her of this fact.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She had looked at him, puzzled. For a moment she seemed on the verge of saying something, then simply shrugged and left him alone. She had no idea why Eddie seemed ashamed to be passing a little time in whittling—her father had done it all the time—but if it was something that needed to be talked about, she supposed Eddie would get to it in his own time.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He knew the guilty feelings were stupid and pointless, but he also knew he felt more comfortable doing this work when Roland and Susannah were out of camp. Old habits, it seemed, sometimes died hard. Beating heroin was child’s play compared to beating your childhood.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When they <i class="calibre3">were</i> away, hunting or shooting or keeping Roland’s peculiar form of school, Eddie found himself able to turn to his piece of wood with surprising skill and increasing pleasure. The shape was in there, all right; he had been right about that. It was a simple one, and Roland’s knife was setting it free with an eerie ease. Eddie thought he was going to get almost all of it, and that meant the slingshot might actually turn out to be a practical weapon. Not much compared to Roland’s big revolvers, maybe, but something he had made himself, just the same. <i class="calibre3">His</i>. And this idea pleased him very much.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When the first crows rose in the air, cawing affrightedly, he did not hear. He was already thinking—hoping—that he might see a tree with a bow trapped in it before too long.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h5"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_4"><b class="calibre4">5</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    HE HEARD THE BEAR approaching before Roland and Susannah did, but not much before—he was lost in that high daze of concentration which accompanies the creative impulse at its sweetest and most powerful. He had suppressed these impulses for most of his life, and now this one held him wholly in its grip. Eddie was a willing prisoner.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was pulled from his daze not by the sound of falling trees but by the rapid thunder of a .45 from the south. He looked up, smiling, and brushed hair from his forehead with a sawdusty hand. In that moment, sitting with his back against a tall pine in the clearing which had become home, his face crisscrossed with opposing beams of green-gold forest light, he looked handsome indeed—a young man with unruly dark hair which constantly tried to spill across his high forehead, a young man with a strong, mobile mouth and hazel eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment his eyes shifted to Roland’s other gun, hanging by its belt from a nearby branch, and he found himself wondering how long it had been since Roland had gone anywhere without at least one of his fabulous weapons hanging by his side. That question led to two others.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    How old <i class="calibre3">was</i> he, this man who had plucked Eddie and Susannah from their world and their <i class="calibre3">whens</i>? And, more important, what was wrong with him?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah had promised to broach that subject . . . if she shot well and didn’t get Roland’s back hair up, that was. Eddie didn’t think Roland would tell her—not at first—but it was time to let old long tall and ugly know that <i class="calibre3">they</i> knew <i class="calibre3">something</i> was wrong.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There’ll be water if God wills it,” Eddie said. He turned back to his carving with a little smile playing on his lips. They had both begun to pick up Roland’s little sayings . . . and he theirs. It was almost as if they were halves of the same—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then a tree fell close by in the forest, and Eddie was on his feet in a second, the half-carved slingshot in one hand, Roland’s knife in the other. He stared across the clearing in the direction of the sound, heart thumping, all his senses finally alert. Something was coming. Now he could hear it, trampling its heedless way through the underbrush, and he marvelled bitterly that this realization had come so late. Far back in his mind, a small voice told him this was what he got. This was what he got for doing something better than Henry, for making Henry nervous.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Another tree fell with a ratcheting, coughing crash. Looking down a ragged aisle between the tall firs, Eddie saw a cloud of sawdust rise in the still air. The creature responsible for that cloud suddenly bellowed—a raging, gut-freezing sound.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was one huge motherfucker, whatever it was.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He dropped the chunk of wood, then flipped Roland’s knife at a tree fifteen feet to his left. It somersaulted twice in the air and then stuck halfway to the hilt in the wood, quivering. He grabbed Roland’s .45 from the place where it hung and cocked it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Stand or run?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But he discovered he no longer had the luxury of that question. The thing was <i class="calibre3">fast</i> as well as huge, and it was now too late to run. A gigantic shape began to disclose itself in that aisle of trees north of the clearing, a shape which towered above all but the tallest trees. It was lumbering directly toward him, and as its eyes fixed upon Eddie Dean, it gave voice to another of those cries.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh man, I’m <i class="calibre3">fucked,”</i> Eddie whispered as another tree bent, cracked like a mortar, then crashed to the forest floor in a cloud of dust and dead needles. Now it was lumbering straight toward the clearing where he stood, a bear the size of King Kong. Its footfalls made the ground shake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What will you do, Eddie?</i> Roland suddenly asked. <i class="calibre3">Think! It’s the only advantage you have over yon beast. What will you do?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He didn’t think he could kill it. Maybe with a bazooka, but probably not with the gunslinger’s .45. He could run, but had an idea that the oncoming beast might be pretty fast when it wanted to be. He guessed the chances of ending up as jam between the great bear’s toes might be as high as fifty-fifty.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    So which one was it going to be? Stand here and start shooting or run like his hair was on fire and his ass was catching?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It occurred to him that there was a third choice. He could climb.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned toward the tree against which he had been leaning. It was a huge, hoary pine, easily the tallest tree in this part of the woods. The first branch spread out over the forest floor in a feathery green fan about eight feet up. Eddie dropped the revolver’s hammer and then jammed the gun into the waistband of his pants. He leaped for the branch, grabbed it, and did a frantic chin-up. Behind him, the bear gave voice to another bellow as it burst into the clearing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear would have had him just the same, would have left Eddie Dean’s guts hanging in gaudy strings from the lowest branches of the pine, if another of those sneezing fits had not come on it at that moment. It kicked the ashy remains of the campfire into a black cloud and then stood almost doubled over, huge front paws on its huge thighs, looking for a moment like an old man in a fur coat, an old man with a cold. It sneezed again and again—<i class="calibre3">AH-CHOW! AH-CHOW! AH-CHOW!</i>—and clouds of parasites blew out of its muzzle. Hot urine flowed in a stream between its legs and hissed out the campfire’s scattered embers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie did not waste the few crucial extra moments he had been given. He went up the tree like a monkey on a stick, pausing only once to make sure the gunslinger’s revolver was still seated firmly in the waistband of his pants. He was in terror, already half convinced that he was going to die (what else could he expect, now that Henry wasn’t around to Watch Out for him?), but a crazy laughter raved through his head just the same. <i class="calibre3">Been treed,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre3">How bout that, sports fans? Been treed by Bearzilla</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The creature raised its head again, the thing turning between its ears catching winks and flashes of sunlight as it did so, then charged Eddie’s tree. It reached high with one paw and slashed forward, meaning to knock Eddie loose like a pinecone. The paw tore through the branch he was standing on just as he lunged upward to the next. That paw tore through one of his shoes as well, pulling it from his foot and sending it flying in two ragged pieces.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That’s okay</i>, Eddie thought. <i class="calibre3">You can have em both, Br’er Bear, if you want. Goddam things were worn out, anyway.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear roared and lashed at the tree, cutting deep wounds in its ancient bark, wounds which bled clear, resinous sap. Eddie kept on yanking himself up. The branches were thinning now, and when he risked a glance down he stared directly into the bear’s muddy eyes. Below its cocked head, the clearing had become a target with the scattered smudge of campfire as its bullseye.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Missed me, you hairy motherf—” Eddie began, and then the bear, its head still cocked back to look at him, sneezed. Eddie was immediately drenched in hot snot that was filled with thousands of small white worms. They wriggled frantically on his shirt, his forearms, his throat and face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie screamed in mingled surprise and revulsion. He began to brush at his eyes and mouth, lost his balance, and just managed to hook an arm around the branch beside him in time. He held on and raked at his skin, wiping off as much of the wormy phlegm as he could. The bear roared and hit the tree again. The pine rocked like a mast in a gale . . . but the fresh claw-marks which appeared were at least seven feet below the branch on which Eddie’s feet were planted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The worms were dying, he realized—must have begun dying as soon as they left the infected swamps inside the monster’s body. It made him feel a little better, and he began to climb again. He stopped twelve feet further up, daring to go no higher. The trunk of the pine, easily eight feet in diameter at its base, was now no more than eighteen inches through the middle. He had distributed his weight on two branches, but he could feel both of them bending springily beneath him. He had a crow’s nest view of the forest and foothills to the west now, spread out below him in an undulating carpet. Under other circumstances, it would have been a view to relish.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Top of the world, Ma,</i> he thought. He looked down into the bear’s upturned face again, and for a moment all coherent thought was driven from his mind by simple amazement.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was something growing out of the bear’s skull, and to Eddie it looked like a small radar-dish.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gadget turned jerkily, kicking up flashes of sun as it did, and Eddie could hear it screaming thinly. He had owned a few old cars in his time—the kind that sat in the used-car lots with the words HANDYMAN’S SPECIAL soaped on the windshields—and he thought the sound coming from that gadget was the sound of bearings which will freeze up if they are not replaced soon.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear uttered a long, purring growl. Yellowish foam, thick with worms, squeezed between its paws in curdled gobbets. If he had never looked into the face of utter lunacy (and he supposed he had, having been eyeball to eyeball with that world-class bitch Detta Walker on more than one occasion), Eddie was looking into it now . . . but that face was, thankfully, a good thirty feet below him, and at their highest reach those killing talons were fifteen feet under the soles of his feet. And, unlike the trees upon which the bear had vented its spleen as it approached the clearing, this one was not dead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Mexican standoff, honey,” Eddie panted. He wiped sweat from his forehead with one sap-sticky hand and flicked the mess down into the bugbear’s face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the creature the Old People had called Mir embraced the tree with its great forepaws and began to shake it. Eddie grabbed the trunk and held on for dear life, eyes squeezed into grim slits, as the pine began to sway back and forth like a pendulum.

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND HALTED AT THE EDGE of the clearing. Susannah, perched on his shoulders, stared unbelievingly across the open space. The creature stood at the base of the tree where Eddie had been when the two of them left the clearing forty-five minutes ago. She could see only chunks and sections of its body through the screen of branches and dark green needles. Roland’s other gunbelt lay beside one of the monster’s feet. The holster, she saw, was empty.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “My God,” she murmured.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear screamed like a distraught woman and began shaking the tree. The branches lashed as if in a high wind. Her eyes skated upward and she saw a dark form near the top. Eddie was hugging the trunk as the tree rocked and rolled. As she watched, one of his hands slipped and flailed wildly for purchase.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">What do we do?”</i> she screamed down at Roland. <i class="calibre3">“It’s goan shake him loose! What do we do?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland tried to think about it, but that queer sensation had returned again—it was always with him now, but stress seemed to make it worse. He felt like two men existing inside one skull. Each man had his own set of memories, and when they began to argue, each insisting that <i class="calibre3">his</i> memories were the true ones, the gunslinger felt as if he were being ripped in two. He made a desperate effort to reconcile these two halves and succeeded . . . at least for the moment.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s one of the Twelve!” he shouted. “One of the Guardians! <i class="calibre3">Must</i> be! But I thought they were—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear bellowed up at Eddie again. Now it began to slap at the tree like a punchy fighter. Branches snapped and fell around its feet in a tangle.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“What?”</i> Susannah screamed. <i class="calibre3">“What’s the rest?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland closed his eyes. Inside his head, a voice shouted, <i class="calibre3">The boy’s name was Jake!</i> Another voice shouted back, <i class="calibre3">There WAS no boy! There WAS no boy, and you know it!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Get away, both of you!</i> he snarled, and then called out aloud: “Shoot it! Shoot it in the ass, Susannah! It’ll turn and charge! When it does, look for something on its head! It—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear squalled again. It gave up slapping the tree and went back to shaking it. Ominous popping, grinding sounds were now coming from the upper part of the trunk.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When he could be heard again, Roland shouted: “I think it looks like a hat! A little steel hat! Shoot it, Susannah! And don’t miss!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Terror suddenly filled her—terror and another emotion, one she would never have expected: crushing loneliness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“No! I’ll miss! You do it, Roland!”</i> She began to fumble his revolver out of the belt she wore, meaning to give it to him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Can’t!” Roland shouted. “The angle’s bad! <i class="calibre3">You</i> have to do it, Susannah! This is the real test, and you’d better pass it!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Roland—”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“It means to snap the top of the tree off!”</i> he roared at her. <i class="calibre3">“Can’t you see that?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She looked at the revolver in her hand. Looked across the clearing, at the gigantic bear obscured in the clouds and sprays of green needles. Looked at Eddie, swaying back and forth like a metronome. Eddie probably had Roland’s other gun, but Susannah could see no way he could use it without being shaken from his perch like an over-ripe plum. Also, he might not shoot at the right thing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She raised the revolver. Her stomach was thick with dread. “Hold me still, Roland,” she said. “If you don’t—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t worry about me!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She fired twice, squeezing the shots as Roland had taught her. The heavy reports cut across the sound of the bear shaking the tree like the cracks of a bullwhip. She saw both bullets strike home in the left cheek of the bear’s rump, less than two inches apart.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It shrieked in surprise, pain, and outrage. One of its huge front paws came out of the dense screen of branches and needles and slapped at the hurt place. The hand came away dripping scarlet and rose back out of sight. Susannah could imagine it up there, examining its bloody palm. Then there was a rushing, rustling, snapping sound as the bear turned, bending down at the same time, dropping to all fours in order to achieve maximum speed. For the first time she saw its face, and her heart quailed. Its muzzle was lathered with foam; its huge eyes glared like lamps. Its shaggy head swung to the left . . . back to the right . . . and centered upon Roland, who stood with his legs apart and Susannah Dean balanced on his shoulders.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    With a shattering roar, the bear charged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    <i class="calibre3">SAY YOUR LESSON, Susannah Dean, and be true.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear came at them in a rumbling lope; it was like watching a runaway factory machine over which someone had thrown a huge, moth-eaten rug.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It looks like a hat! A little steel hat!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She saw it ... but it didn’t look like a hat to her. It looked like a radar-dish—a much smaller version of the kind she had seen in MovieTone newsreel stories about how the DEW-line was keeping everyone safe from a Russian sneak attack. It was bigger than the pebbles she had shot off the boulder earlier, but the distance was greater. Sun and shadow ran across it in deceiving dapples.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I do not aim with my hand; she who aims with her hand has forgotten the face of her father.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">

  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I do not shoot with my hand; she who shoots with her hand has forgotten the face of her father.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">

  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I do not kill with my gun; she who kills with her gun—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shoot it!” Roland roared. “Susannah, <i class="calibre3">shoot it</i>!<i class="calibre3">”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    With the trigger as yet unpulled, she saw the bullet go home, guided from muzzle to target by nothing more or less than her heart’s fierce desire that it should fly true. All fear fell away. What was left was a feeling of deep coldness and she had time to think: <i class="calibre3">This is what he feels</i>. <i class="calibre3">My God—how does he stand it?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I kill with my heart, motherfucker,” she said, and the gunslinger’s revolver roared in her hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    THE SILVERY THING SPUN on a steel rod planted in the bear’s skull. Susannah’s bullet struck it dead center and the radar-dish blew into a hundred glittering fragments. The pole itself was suddenly engulfed in a burst of crackling blue fire which reached out in a net and seemed to grasp the sides of the bear’s face for a moment.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It rose on its rear legs with a whistling howl of agony, its front paws boxing aimlessly at the air. It turned in a wide, staggering circle and began to flap its arms, as if it had decided to fly away. It tried to roar again but what came out instead was a weird warbling sound like an air-raid siren.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It is very well.” Roland sounded exhausted. “A good shot, fair and true.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Should I shoot it again?” she asked uncertainly. The bear was still blundering around in its mad circle but now its body had begun to tilt sidewards and inwards. It struck a small tree, rebounded, almost fell over, and then began to circle again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No need,” Roland said. She felt his hands grip her waist and lift her. A moment later she was sitting on the ground with her thighs folded beneath her. Eddie was slowly and shakily descending the pine, but she didn’t see him. She could not take her eyes from the bear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She had seen the whales at the Seaquarium near Mystic, Connecticut, and believed they had been bigger than this—much bigger, probably—but this was certainly the largest land creature she had ever seen. And it was clearly dying. Its roars had become liquid bubbling sounds, and although its eyes were open, it seemed blind. It flailed aimlessly about the camp, knocking over a rack of curing hides, stamping flat the little shelter she shared with Eddie, caroming off trees. She could see the steel post rising from its head. Tendrils of smoke were rising around it, as if her shot had ignited its brains.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie reached the lowest branch of the tree which had saved his life and sat shakily astride it. “Holy Mary Mother of God,” he said. “I’m looking right at it and I still don’t beli—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bear wheeled back toward him. Eddie leaped nimbly from the tree and streaked toward Susannah and Roland. The bear took no notice, it marched drunkenly to the pine which had been Eddie’s refuge, tried to grasp it, failed, and sank to its knees. Now they could hear other sounds coming from inside it, sounds that made Eddie think of some huge truck engine stripping its gears.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A spasm convulsed it, bowed its back. Its front claws rose and gored madly at its own face. Worm-infested blood flew and splattered. Then it fell over, making the ground tremble with its fall, and lay still. After all its strange centuries, the bear the Old People had called Mir—the world beneath the world—was dead.

  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE PICKED SUSANNAH UP, held her with his sticky hands locked together at the small of her back, and kissed her deeply. He reeked of sweat and pine-tar. She touched his cheeks, his neck; she ran her hands through his wet hair. She felt an insane urge to touch him everywhere until she was absolutely sure of his reality.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It almost had me,” he said. “It was like being on some crazy carnival ride. What a shot! Jesus, Suze—what a shot!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I hope I never have to do anything like that again,” she said . . . but a small voice at the center of her demurred. That voice suggested that she could not <i class="calibre3">wait</i> to do something like that again. And it was cold, that voice. Cold.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What was—” he began, turning toward Roland, but Roland was no longer standing there. He was walking slowly toward the bear, which now lay on the ground with its shaggy knees up. From within it came a series of muffled gasps and gurgles as its strange guts continued to slowly run down.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland saw his knife planted deep in a tree near the scarred veteran that had saved Eddie’s life. He pulled it free and wiped it clean on the soft deerskin shirt which had replaced the tatters he had been wearing when the three of them had left the beach. He stood by the bear, looking down at it with an expression of pity and wonder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Hello, stranger</i>, he thought. <i class="calibre3">Hello, old friend. I never believed in you, not really. I believe Alain did, and I know that Cuthbert did—Cuthbert believed in</i> everything<i class="calibre3">—but I was the hardheaded one. I thought you were only a tale for children . . . another wind which blew around in my old nurse’s hollow head before finally escaping her jabbering mouth. But you were here all along, another refugee of the old times, like the pump at the way station and the old machines under the mountains. Are the Slow Mutants who worshipped those broken remnants the final descendents of the people who once lived in this forest and finally fled your wrath? I don’t know, will never know . . . but it feels right. Yes. And then I came with my friends—my deadly new friends, who are becoming so much like my deadly old friends. We came, weaving our magic circle around its and around everything we touch, strand by poisonous strand, and now here you lie, at our feet. The world has moved on again, and this time, old friend, it’s you who have been left behind.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The monster’s body still radiated a deep, sick heat. Parasites were leaving its mouth and tattered nostrils in hordes, but they died almost at once. Waxy-white piles of them were growing on either side of the bear’s head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie approached slowly. He had shifted Susannah over to one hip, carrying her as a mother might carry a baby. “What was it, Roland? Do you know?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He called it a Guardian, I think,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” Roland’s voice was slow with amazement. “I thought they were all gone, <i class="calibre3">must</i> all be gone . . . if they ever existed outside of the old wives’ tales in the first place.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Whatever it was, it was one crazy mother,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland smiled a little. “If you’d lived two or three thousand years, you’d be one crazy mother, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Two or three thousand . . . Christ!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah said, “Is it a bear? Really? And what’s that?” She was pointing at what appeared to be a square metal tag set high on one of the bear’s thick rear legs. It was almost overgrown with tough tangles of hair, but the afternoon sun had pricked out a single starpoint of light on its stainless steel surface, revealing it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie knelt and reached hesitantly toward the tag, aware that strange muffled clicks and clacks were still coming from deep inside the fallen giant. He looked at Roland.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go ahead,” the gunslinger told him. “It’s finished.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie pushed a clump of hair aside and leaned closer. Words had been stamped into the metal. They were quite badly eroded, but he found that with a little effort he could read them.

    “It can’t be,” Susannah said. “When I shot it, it <i class="calibre3">bled.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Maybe so, but your ordinary, garden-variety bear doesn’t have a radar-dish growing out of its head. And, so far as I know, your ordinary, garden-variety bear doesn’t live to be two or three th—” He broke off suddenly, looking at Roland. When he spoke again, his voice was revolted. “Roland, what are you doing?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland did not reply; did not <i class="calibre3">need</i> to reply. What he was doing—gouging out one of the bear’s eyes with his knife—was perfectly obvious. The surgery was quick, neat, and precise. When it was completed he balanced an oozing brown ball of jelly on the blade of his knife for a moment and then flicked it aside. A few more worms made their way out of the staring hole, tried to squirm their way down the bear’s muzzle, and died.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger leaned over the eyesocket of Shardik, the great Guardian bear, and peered inside. “Come and look, both of you,” he said. “I’ll show you a wonder of the latter days.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Put me down, Eddie,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He did so, and she moved swiftly on her hands and upper thighs to where the gunslinger was hunkered down over the bear’s wide, slack face. Eddie joined them, looking between their shoulders. The three of them gazed in rapt silence for nearly a full minute; the only noise came from the crows which still circled and scolded in the sky.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blood oozed from the socket in a few thick, dying trickles. Yet it was not <i class="calibre3">just</i> blood, Eddie saw. There was also a clear fluid which gave off an identifiable scent—bananas. And, embedded in the delicate crisscross of tendons which shaped the socket, he saw a webwork of what looked like strings. Beyond them, at the back of then socket, was a red spark, blinking on and off. It illuminated a tiny square board marked with silvery squiggles of what could only be solder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It isn’t a bear, it’s a fucking Sony Walkman,” he muttered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah looked around at him. “What?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nothing.” Eddie glanced at Roland. “Do you think it’s safe to reach in?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shrugged. “I think so. If there was a demon in this creature, it’s fled.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie reached in with his little finger, nerves set to draw back if he felt even a tickle of electricity. He touched the cooling meat inside the eyesocket, which was nearly the size of a baseball, and then one of those strings. Except it wasn’t a string; it was a gossamer-thin strand of steel. He withdrew his finger and saw the tiny red spark blink once more before going out forever.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shardik,” Eddie murmured. “I <i class="calibre3">know</i> that name, but I can’t place it. Does it mean anything to you, Suze?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She shook her head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The thing is . . .” Eddie laughed helplessly. “I associate it with rabbits. Isn’t that nuts?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland stood up. His knees popped like gunshots. “We’ll have to move camp,” he said. “The ground here is spoiled. The other clearing, the one where we go to shoot, will—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He took two trembling steps and then collapsed to his knees, palms pressed to the sides of his sagging head.

  <div class="tx">
    THAT NIGHT THE THREE of them sat around a huge bonfire Eddie and Susannah had built in the clearing Eddie called “the shooting gallery.” It would have been a bad place to camp in the wintertime, open to the valley as it was, but for now it was fine. Eddie guessed that here in Roland’s world it was still late summer.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The black vault of the sky arched overhead, speckled by what seemed to be whole galaxies. Almost straight ahead to the south, across the river of darkness that was the valley, Eddie could see Old Mother rising above the distant, unseen horizon. He glanced at Roland, who sat huddled by the fire with three skins wrapped around his shoulders despite the warmth of the night and the heat of the fire. There was an untouched plate of food by his side and a bone cradled in his hands. Eddie glanced back at the sky and thought of a story the gunslinger had told him and Susannah on one of the long days they had spent moving away from the beach, through the foothills, and finally into these deep woods where they had found a temporary refuge.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Before time began, Roland said, Old Star and Old Mother had been young and passionate newlyweds. Then one day there had been a terrible argument. Old Mother (who in those long-ago days had been known by her real name, which was Lydia) had caught Old Star (whose real name was Apon) hanging about a beautiful young woman named Cassiopeia. They’d had a real bang-up fight, those two, a hair-pulling, eye-gouging, crockery-throwing fight. One of those thrown bits of crockery had become the earth; a smaller shard the moon; a coal from their kitchen stove had become the sun. In the end, the gods had stepped in so Apon and Lydia might not, in their anger, destroy the universe before it was fairly begun. Cassiopeia, the saucy jade who caused the trouble in the first place (“Yeah, right—it’s always the woman,” Susannah had said at this point), had been banished to a rocking-chair made of stars forever and ever. Yet not even this had solved the-problem. Lydia had been willing to try again, but Apon was stiffnecked and full of pride (“Yeah, always blame the man,” Eddie had grunted at this point). So they had parted, and now they look at each other in mingled hatred and longing from across the star-strewn wreckage of their divorce. Apon and Lydia are three billion years gone, the gunslinger told them; they have become Old Star and Old Mother, the north and south, each pining for the other but both now too proud to beg for reconciliation . . . and Cassiopeia sits off to the side in her chair, rocking and laughing at them both.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was startled by a soft touch on his arm. It was Susannah. “Come on,” she said. “We’ve got to make him talk.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie carried her to the campfire and put her down carefully on Roland’s right side. He sat on Roland’s left. Roland looked first at Susannah, then at Eddie.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How close you both sit to me,” he remarked. “Like lovers ... or warders in a gaol.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s time for you to do some talking.” Susannah’s voice was low, clear, and musical. “If we’re your companions, Roland—and it seems like we are, like it or not—it’s time you started <i class="calibre3">treating</i> us as companions. Tell us what’s wrong . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “. . . and what we can do about it,” Eddie finished.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland sighed deeply. “I don’t know how to begin,” he said. “It’s been so long since I’ve had companions . . . or a tale to tell . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Start with the bear,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah leaned forward and touched the jawbone Roland held in his hands. It frightened her, but she touched it anyway. “And finish with this.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” Roland lifted the bone to eye-level and looked at it for a moment before dropping it back into his lap. “We’ll have to speak of this, won’t we? It’s the center of the thing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But the bear came first.

    “THIS IS THE STORY I was told when I was a child,” Roland said. “When everything was new, the Great Old Ones-they weren’t gods, but people who had almost the knowledge of gods-created Twelve Guardians to stand watch at the twelve portals which lead in and out of the world. Sometimes I heard that these portals were natural things, like the constellations we see in the sky or the bottomless crack in the earth we called Dragon’s Grave, because of the great burst of steam they gave off every thirty or forty days. But other people—one I remember in particular, the head cook in my father’s castle, a man named Hax—said they were not natural, that they had been created by the Great Old Ones themselves, in the days before they hanged themselves with pride like a noose and disappeared from the earth. Hax used to say that the creation of the Twelve Guardians was the last act of the Great Old Ones, their attempt to atone for the great wrongs they had done to each other, and to the earth itself.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Portals,” Eddie mused. “<i class="calibre3">Doors</i>, you mean. We’re back to those again. Do these doors that lead in and out of the world open on the world Suze and I came from? Like the ones we found along the beach?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know,” Roland said. “For every thing I do know, there are a hundred things I don’t. You—both of you—will have to reconcile yourselves to that fact. The world has moved on, we say. When it did, it went like a great receding wave, leaving only wreckage behind ... wreckage that sometimes looks like a map.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, make a <i class="calibre3">guess</i>!” Eddie exclaimed, and the raw eagerness in his voice told the gunslinger that Eddie had not given up the idea of returning to his own world—and Susannah’s—even now Not entirely.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Leave him be, Eddie,” Susannah said. “The man don’t guess.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not true—sometimes the man <i class="calibre3">does</i>,” Roland said, surprising them both. “When guessing’s the only thing left, sometimes he does. The answer is no. I don’t think—I don’t <i class="calibre3">guess</i>—that these portals are much like the doors on the beach. I don’t <i class="calibre3">guess</i> they go to a <i class="calibre3">where</i> or <i class="calibre3">when</i> that we would recognize. I think the doors on the beach—the ones that led into the world you both came from—were like the pivot at the center of a child’s teeterboard. Do you know what that is?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Seesaw?” Susannah asked, and tipped her hand back and forth to demonstrate.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes!” Roland agreed, looking pleased. “Just so. On one end of this sawsee—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Seesaw,” Eddie said, smiling a little.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. On one end, my <i class="calibre3">ka</i>. On the other, that of the man in black—Walter. The doors were the center, creations of the tension between two opposing destinies. These other portals are things far greater than Walter, or me, or the little fellowship we three have made.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you saying,” Susannah asked hesitantly, “that the portals where these Guardians stand watch are <i class="calibre3">outside ka</i>? Beyond <i class="calibre3">ka</i>?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m saying that I believe so.” He offered his own brief smile, a thin sickle in the firelight. “That I <i class="calibre3">guess</i> so.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was silent a moment, then he picked up a stick of his own. He brushed away the carpet of pine needles and used the stick to draw in the dirt beneath:

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="004" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00004.jpeg"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Here is the world as I was told it existed when I was a child. The Xs are the portals standing in a ring at its eternal edge. If one drew six lines, connecting these portals in pairs—so—”
  </div>

  <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="005" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00005.jpeg"/></div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked up. “Do you see where the lines cross in the center?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie felt gooseflesh crawl up his back and down his arms. His mouth was suddenly dry. “Is that it, Roland? Is that—?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. His long, lined face was grave. “At this nexus lies the Great Portal, the so-called Thirteenth Gate which rules not just this world but all worlds.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He tapped the center of the circle.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Here is the Dark Tower for which I’ve searched my whole life.”

  <div class="tx">
    THE GUNSLINGER RESUMED: “At each of the twelve lesser portals the Great Old Ones set a Guardian. In my childhood I could have named them all in the rimes my nursemaid-and Hax the cook-taught to me ... but my childhood was long ago. There was the Bear, of course, and the Fish ... the Lion ... the Bat. And the Turtle—he was an important one ...”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger looked up into the starry sky, his brow creased in deep thought. Then an amazingly sunny smile broke across his features and he recited:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">“See the TURTLE of enormous girth!</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">On his shell he holds the earth.</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">His thought is slow but always kind;</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">He holds us all within-his mind.</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">On his back all vows are made;</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">He sees the truth but mayn’t aid.</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">He loves the land and loves the sea,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">And even loves a child like me.”</i>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland uttered a small, bemused laugh. “Hax taught that to me, singing it as he stirred the frosting for some cake and gave me little nips of the sweet from the edge of his spoon. Amazing what we remember, isn’t it? Anyway, as I grew older, I came to believe that the Guardians didn’t really exist—that they were symbols rather than substance. It seems that I was wrong.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I called it a robot,” Eddie said, “but that’s not what it really was. Susannah’s right—the only thing robots bleed when you shoot them is Quaker State 10-40. I think it was what people of my world call a cyborg, Roland—a creature that’s part machine and part flesh and blood. There was a movie I saw ... we told you about movies, didn’t we?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Smiling a little, Roland nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, this movie was called <i class="calibre3">Robocop,</i> and the guy in it wasn’t a lot different from the bear Susannah killed. How did you know where she should shoot it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That I remembered from the old tales as Hax told them,” he said. “If it had been up to my nursemaid, Eddie, you’d be in the belly of the bear now. Do they sometimes tell puzzled children in your world to put on their thinking caps?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Susannah said. “They sure do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s said here, as well, and the saying comes from the story of the Guardians. Each supposedly carried an extra brain on the outside of its head. In a hat.” He looked at them with his dreadfully haunted eyes and smiled again. “It didn’t look much like a hat, did it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” Eddie said, “but the story was close enough to save our bacon.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think now that I’ve been looking for one of the Guardians ever since I began my quest,” Roland said. “When we find the portal this Shardik guarded—and that should only be a matter of following its backtrail—we will finally have a course to follow. We must set the portal to our backs and then simply move straight ahead. At the center of the circle ... the Tower.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie opened his mouth to say, <i class="calibre3">All right, let’s talk about this Tower. Finally, once and for all, let’s talk about it—what it is, what it means, and, most important of all, what happens to us when we get there.</i> But no sound came out, and after a moment he closed his mouth again. This wasn’t the time—not now, with Roland in such obvious pain. Not now, with only the spark of their campfire to keep the night at bay.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So now we come to the other part,” Roland said heavily. “I have finally found my course—after all the long years I have found my course—but at the same time I seem to be losing my sanity. I can feel it crumbling away beneath my feet, like a steep embankment which has been loosened by rain. This is my punishment for letting a boy who never existed fall to his death. And that is also <i class="calibre3">ka.</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who is this boy, Roland?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland glanced at Eddie. “Do you know?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shook his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But I spoke of him,” Roland said. “In fact, I <i class="calibre3">raved</i> of him, when the infection was at its worst and I was near dying.” The gunslinger’s voice suddenly rose half an octave, and his imitation of Eddie’s voice was so good that Susannah felt a coil of superstitious fright. “‘If you don’t shut up about that goddam kid, Roland, I’ll gag you with your own shirt! I’m sick of hearing about him!’ Do you remember saying that, Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie thought it over carefully. Roland had spoken of a thousand things as the two of them made their tortuous way up the beach from the door marked THE PRISONER to the one marked THE LADY OF THE SHADOWS, and he had mentioned what seemed like a thousand names in his fever-heated monologues—Alain, Cort, Jamie de Curry, Cuthbert (this one more often than all the others), Hax, Martin (or perhaps it was Marten, like the animal), Walter, Susan, even a guy with the unlikely name of Zoltan. Eddie had gotten very tired of hearing about these people he had never met (and didn’t care to meet), but of course Eddie had had a few problems of his own at that time, heroin withdrawal and cosmic jet-lag being only two of them. And, if he was to be fair, he guessed Roland had gotten as tired of Eddie’s own Fractured Fairy Tales—the ones about how he and Henry had grown up together and turned into junkies together—as Eddie had of Roland’s.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But he couldn’t remember ever telling Roland he would gag him with his own shirt if he didn’t stop talking about some kid.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nothing comes to you?” Roland asked. “Nothing at all?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Was</i> there something? Some far-off tickle, like the feeling of <i class="calibre3">déjà vu</i> he’d gotten when he saw the slingshot hiding inside the chunk of wood jutting out of the stump? Eddie tried to find that tickle, but it was gone. He decided it had never been there in the first place; he only <i class="calibre3">wanted</i> it to be there, because Roland was hurting so badly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” he said. “Sorry, man.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But I <i class="calibre3">did</i> tell you.” Roland’s tone was calm, but urgency ran and pulsed beneath it like a scarlet thread. “The boy’s name was Jake. I sacrificed him—killed him—in order that I might finally catch up with Walter and make him talk. I killed him under the mountains.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    On this point Eddie could be more positive. “Well, maybe that’s what happened, but it’s not what you <i class="calibre3">said</i> happened. You said you went under the mountains alone, on some kind of crazy handcar. You talked about <i class="calibre3">that</i> a lot while we were coming up the beach, Roland. About how scary it was to be alone.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I remember. But I also remember telling you about the boy, and how he fell from the trestle into the chasm. And it’s the distance between those two memories that is pulling my mind apart.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t understand any of this,” Susannah said worriedly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think,” Roland said, “that I’m just beginning to.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He threw more wood on the fire, sending thick sheaves of red sparks spiralling up into the dark sky, and then settled back between them. “I’ll tell you a story that’s true,” he said, “and then I’ll tell you a story that isn’t true . . . but <i class="calibre3">should</i> be.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I bought a mule in Pricetown, and when I finally got to Tull, the last town before the desert, it was still fresh . . .”

  <div class="tx">
    SO THE GUNSLINGER EMBARKED on the most recent part of his long tale. Eddie had heard isolated fragments of the story, but he listened in utter fascination, as did Susannah, for whom it was completely new. He told them about the bar with the endless game of Watch Me going on in the corner, the piano player named Sheb, the woman named Allie with the scar on her forehead . . . and about Nort, the weed-eater who had died and then been brought back to some sort of tenebrous life by the man in black. He told them about Sylvia Pittston, that avatar of religious insanity, and about the final apocalyptic slaughter, in which he, Roland the Gunslinger, had killed every man, woman, and child in town.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Holy crispy crap!” Eddie said in a low, shaky voice. “Now I know why you were so low on shells, Roland.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Be quiet!” Susannah snapped. “Let him finish!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland went on, telling his story as stolidly as he had crossed the desert after passing the hut of the last Dweller, a young man whose wild, strawberry-colored hair had reached almost to his waist. He told them about how his mule had finally died. He even told them about how the Dweller’s pet bird, Zoltan, had eaten the mule’s eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He told them about the long desert days and the short desert nights which had come next, and how he had followed the cool remains of Walter’s campfires, and how he had come at last, reeling and dying of dehydration, to the way station.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It was empty. It had been empty, I think, since the days when yonder great bear was still a newly made thing. I stayed a night and pushed on. That’s what happened . . . but now I’ll tell you another story.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The one that isn’t true but should be?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “In this made-up story—this fable—a gunslinger named Roland met a boy named Jake at the way station. This boy was from your world, from your city of New York, and from a <i class="calibre3">when</i> someplace between Eddie’s 1987 and Odetta Holmes’s 1963.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was leaning forward eagerly. “Is there a door in this story, Roland? A door marked THE BOY, or something like that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “The boy’s doorway was death. He was on his way to school when a man—a man I believed to be Walter-pushed him into the street, where he was run over by a car. He heard this man say something like ‘Get out of the way, let me through, I’m a priest.’ Jake <i class="calibre3">saw</i> this man—just for an instant—and then he was in <i class="calibre3">my</i> world.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger paused, looking into the fire.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now I want to leave this story of the boy who was never there and go back to what really happened for a minute. All right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie and Susannah exchanged a puzzled glance and then Eddie made an “after you, my dear Alphonse” gesture with his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “As I have said, the way station was deserted. There was, however, a pump that still worked. It was at the back of the stable where the coach-horses were kept. I followed my ears to it, but I would have found it even if it had been completely silent. I <i class="calibre3">smelled</i> the water, you see. After enough time in the desert, when you are on the edge of dying from thirst, you can really do that. I drank and then slept. When I woke, I drank again. I wanted to push on at once—the need to do that was like a fever. The medicine you brought me from your world—the <i class="calibre3">astin</i>—is wonderful stuff, Eddie, but there are fevers beyond the power of any medicine to cure, and this was one of them. I knew my body needed rest, but it still took every ounce of my willpower to stay there even one night. In the morning I felt rested, and so I refilled my waterskins and pushed on. <i class="calibre3">I took nothing from that place but water.</i> That’s the most important part of what really happened.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah spoke in her most reasonable, pleasant, and Odetta Holmes-like voice. “All right, that’s what really happened. You refilled your waterskins and went on. Now tell us the rest of what <i class="calibre3">didn’t</i> happen, Roland”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger put the jawbone in his lap for a moment, curled his hands into fists, and rubbed his eyes with them—a curiously childlike gesture. Then he grasped the jawbone again, as if for courage, and went on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I hypnotized the boy who wasn’t there,” he said. “I did it with one of my shells. It’s a trick I’ve known for years, and I learned it from a very unlikely source—Marten, my father’s court magician. The boy was a good subject. While he was tranced, he told me the circumstances of his death, as I’ve told them to you. When I’d gotten as much of his story as I felt I could without upsetting or actually hurting him, I gave him a command that he should not remember anything about his dying when he woke up again.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who’d want to?” Eddie muttered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “Who, indeed? The boy passed from his trance directly into a natural sleep. I also slept. When we woke, I told the boy that I meant to catch the man in black. He knew who I meant; Walter had also stopped at the way station. Jake was afraid and hid from him. I’m sure Walter knew he was there, but it suited his purpose to pretend he didn’t. He left the boy behind like a set trap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I asked him if there was anything to eat there. It seemed to me there must be. He looked healthy enough, and the desert climate is wonderful when it comes to preserving things. He had a little dried meat, and he said there was a cellar. He hadn’t explored that, because he was afraid.” The gunslinger looked at them grimly. “He was right to be afraid. I found food ... and I also found a Speaking Demon.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked down at the jawbone with widening eyes. Orange firelight danced on its ancient curves and hoodoo teeth. “Speaking Demon? Do you mean <i class="calibre3">that</i> thing?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” he said. “Yes. Both. Listen and you shall understand.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He told them about the inhuman groans he’d heard coming from the earth beyond the cellar; how he had seen sand running from between two of the old blocks which made up the cellar walls. He told them of approaching the hole that was appearing there as Jake screamed for him to come up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had commanded the demon to speak . . . and so the demon had, in the voice of Allie, the woman with the scar on her forehead, the woman who had kept the bar in Tull. <i class="calibre3">Go slow past the Drawers, gunslinger. While you travel with the boy, the man in black travels with your soul in his pocket</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The Drawers?” Susannah asked, startled.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” Roland looked at her closely. “That means something to you, doesn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes . . . and no.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She spoke with great hesitation. Some of it, Roland divined, was simple reluctance to speak of things which were painful to her. He thought most of it, however, was a desire not to confuse issues which were already confused by saying more than she actually knew. He admired that. He admired <i class="calibre3">her</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Say what you can be sure of,” he said. “No more than that.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right. The Drawers was a place Detta Walker knew about. A place Detta <i class="calibre3">thought</i> about. It’s a slang term, one she picked up from listening to the grownups when they sat out on the porch and drank beer and talked about the old days. It means a place that’s spoiled, or useless, or both. There was something in the Drawers—in the <i class="calibre3">idea</i> of the Drawers—that called to Detta. Don’t ask me what; I might have known once, but I don’t anymore. And don’t want to.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Detta stole my Aunt Blue’s china plate—the one my folks gave her for a wedding present—and took it to the Drawers—<i class="calibre3">her</i> Drawers—to break it. That place was a gravel-pit filled with trash. A dumping-ground. Later on, she sometimes picked up boys at roadhouses.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah dropped her head for a moment, her lips pressed tightly together. Then she looked up again and went on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">White</i> boys. And when they took her back to their cars in the parking lot, she cock-teased them and then ran off. Those parking lots . . . they were the Drawers, too. It was a dangerous game, but she was young enough, quick enough, and mean enough to play it to the hilt and enjoy it. Later, in New York, she’d go on shoplifting expeditions . . . you know about that. Both of you. Always to the fancy stores—Macy’s, Gimbel’s, Bloomingdale’s—and steal trinkets. And when she made up her mind to go on one of those sprees, she’d think: <i class="calibre3">I’m goan to the Drawers today. Goan steal me some shit fum de white folks. Goan steal me sumpin forspecial and den break dat sumbitch.</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She paused, lips trembling, looking into the fire. When she looked around again, Roland and Eddie saw tears standing in her eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m crying, but don’t let that fool you. I remember doing those things, and I remember <i class="calibre3">enjoying</i> them. I guess I’m crying because I know I’d do it all again, if the circumstances were right.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland seemed to have regained some of his old serenity, his weird equilibrium. “We have a proverb in my country, Susannah: ‘The wise thief always prospers.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t see nothing wise about stealing a bunch of paste jewelry,” she said sharply.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Were you ever caught?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He spread his hands as if to say, <i class="calibre3">There you have it</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So for Detta Walker, the Drawers were bad places?” Eddie asked. “Is that right? Because it doesn’t exactly <i class="calibre3">feel</i> right.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Bad and good at the same time. They were <i class="calibre3">powerful</i> places, places where she ... she <i class="calibre3">reinvented</i> herself, I suppose you could say . . . but they were <i class="calibre3">lost</i> places, too. And this is all off the subject of Roland’s ghost-boy, isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Maybe not,” Roland said. “We had Drawers as well, you see, in my world. It was slang for us, too, and the meanings are very similar.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What did it mean to you and your friends?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That varied slightly from place to place and situation to situation. It might mean a trash-midden. It might mean a whorehouse or a place where men came to gamble or chew devil-weed. But the most common meaning that I know is also the simplest.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at them both.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The Drawers are places of desolation,” he said. “The Drawers are the waste lands.”

    THIS TIME SUSANNAH THREW more wood on the fire. In the south, Old Mother blazed on brilliantly, not flickering. She knew from her school studies what that meant: it was a planet, not a star. <i class="calibre3">Venus?</i> she wondered. <i class="calibre3">Or is the solar system of which this world is a part as different as everything else?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Again that feeling of unreality—the feeling that all this must surely be a dream—washed over her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go on,” she said. “What happened after the voice warned you about the Drawers and the little boy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I punched my hand into the hole the sand had come from, as I was taught to do if such a thing ever happened to me. What I plucked forth was a jawbone . . . but not this one. The jawbone I took from the wall of the way station was much larger; from one of the Great Old Ones, I have almost no doubt.” “What happened to it?” Susannah asked quietly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “One night I gave it to the boy,” Roland said. The fire painted his cheeks with hot orange highlights and dancing shadows. “As a protection—a kind of talisman. Later I felt it had served its purpose and threw it away.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So whose jawbone you got there, Roland?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland held it up, looked at it long and thoughtfully, and let it drop back. “Later, after Jake . . . after he died . . . I caught up with the men I had been chasing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “With Walter,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. We held palaver, he and I ... <i class="calibre3">long</i> palaver. I fell asleep at some point, and when I woke up, Walter was dead. A hundred years dead at least, and probably more. There was nothing left of him but bones, which was fitting enough, since we were in a place of bones.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah, it must have been a pretty long palaver, all right,” Eddie said dryly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah frowned slightly at this, but Roland only nodded. “Long and long,” he said, looking into the fire.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You came to in the morning and reached the Western Sea that very evening,” Eddie said. “That night the lobstrosities came, right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded again. “Yes. But before I left the place where Walter and I had spoken . . . or dreamed . . . or whatever it was we did . . . I took this from the skull of his skeleton.” He lifted the bone and the orange light again skated off the teeth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Walter’s jawbone</i>, Eddie thought, and felt a little chill work through him: <i class="calibre3">The jawbone of the man in black. Remember this, Eddie my boy, the next time you get to thinking Roland’s maybe just another one of the guys. He’s been carrying it around with him all this time like some kind of a . . . a cannibal’s trophy. Jee-sus.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I remember what I thought when I took it,” Roland said. “I remember very well; it is the only memory I have of that time which hasn’t doubled on me. I thought, ‘It was bad luck to throw away what I found when I found the boy. This will replace it.’ Only then I heard Walter’s laughter—his mean, tittery laughter. I heard his voice, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What did he say?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “‘Too late, gunslinger,’ ” Roland said. “That’s what he said. ‛Too late—your luck will be bad from now until the end of eternity—that is your <i class="calibre3">ka</i>.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h16"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_15"><b class="calibre4">16</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “ALL RIGHT,” EDDIE SAID at last. “I understand the basic paradox. Your memory is divided—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Not</i> divided. <i class="calibre3">Doubled.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right; it’s almost the same thing, isn’t it?” Eddie grasped a twig and made his own little drawing in the sand:

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="006" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00006.jpeg"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He tapped the line on the left. “This is your memory of the time before you got to the way station—a single track.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He tapped the line on the right. “And after you came out on the far side of the mountains in the place of bones . . . the place where Walter was waiting for you. <i class="calibre3">Also</i> a single track.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now Eddie first indicated the middle area and then drew a rough circle around it.
  </div>

  <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="007" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00007.jpeg"/></div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s what you’ve got to do, Roland-close this double track off. Build a stockade around it in your mind and then forget it. Because it doesn’t <i class="calibre3">mean</i> anything, it doesn’t <i class="calibre3">change</i> anything, it’s <i class="calibre3">gone</i>, it’s <i class="calibre3">done—</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But it isn’t.” Roland held up the bone. “If my memories of the boy Jake are false—and I know they are—<i class="calibre3">how can I have this?</i> I took it to replace the one I threw away . . . but the one I threw away came from the cellar of the way station, and along the track I know is true, <i class="calibre3">I never went down cellar!</i> I never spoke with the demon! I moved on alone, with fresh water and <i class="calibre3">nothing else</i>!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland, listen to me,” Eddie said earnestly. “If that jawbone you’re holding was the one from the way station, that would be one thing. But isn’t it possible that if you hallucinated that whole thing—the way station, the kid, the Speaking Demon—then maybe you took Walter’s jawbone because—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It was no hallucination,” Roland said. He looked at them both with his faded blue bombardier’s eyes and then did something neither expected . . . something Eddie would have sworn Roland did not know he meant to do himself.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He threw the jawbone into the fire.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h17"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_16"><b class="calibre4">17</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    <b class="calibre4">FOR A MOMENT IT</b> only lay there, a white relic bent in a ghostly half-grin. Then it suddenly blazed red, washing the clearing with dazzling scarlet light. Eddie and Susannah cried out and threw their hands up to shield their eyes from that burning shape.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bone began to change. Not to melt, but to <i class="calibre3">change</i>. The teeth which leaned out of it like gravestones began to draw together in clumps. The mild curve of the upper arc straightened, then snubbed down at the tip.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie’s hands fell into his lap and he stared at the bone which was no longer a bone with gape-jawed wonder. It was now the color of burning steel. The teeth had become three inverted V’s, the middle one larger than those on the ends. And suddenly Eddie saw what it wanted to become, just as he had seen the slingshot in the wood of the stump.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought it was a key.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You must remember the shape</i>, he thought feverishly. <i class="calibre3">You must, you must.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His eyes traced it desperately—three V’s, the one in the center larger and deeper than the two on the end. Three notches . . . and the one closest the end had a squiggle, the shallow shape of a lower-case <i class="calibre3">s</i> . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the shape in the flames changed again. The bone which had become something like a key drew inward, concentrating itself into bright, overlapping petals and folds as dark and velvety as a moonless summer midnight. For a moment Eddie saw a rose—a triumphant rose that might have bloomed in the dawn of this world’s first day, a thing of depthless, timeless beauty. His eye saw, and his heart was opened. It was as if all love and life had suddenly risen from Roland’s dead artifact; it was there in the fire, burning out in triumph and some wonderful, inchoate defiance, declaring that despair was a mirage and death a dream.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The rose!</i> he thought incoherently. <i class="calibre3">First the key, then the rose! Behold! Behold the opening of the way to the Tower!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a thick cough from the fire. A fan of sparks twisted outwards. Susannah screamed and rolled away, beating at the orange flecks on her dress as the flames gushed upward toward the starry sky. Eddie didn’t move. He sat transfixed in his vision, held in a cradle of wonder which was both gorgeous and terrible, unmindful of the sparks which danced across his skin. Then the flames sank back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The bone was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The key was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The rose was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Remember</i>, he thought. <i class="calibre3">Remember the rose . . . and remember the Shape of the key.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah was sobbing with shock and terror, but he ignored her for the moment and found the stick with which he and Roland had both drawn. And in the dirt he made this shape with a shaking hand:

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="008" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00008.jpeg"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h18"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_17"><b class="calibre4">18</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “WHY DID YOU DO it?” Susannah asked at last. “Why, for God’s sake—and what was it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Fifteen minutes had gone by. The fire had been allowed to burn low; the scattered embers had either been stamped out or had gone out on their own. Eddie sat with his arms about his wife: Susannah sat before him, with her back against his chest. Roland was off to one side, knees hugged to his chest, looking moodily into the orange-red coals. So far as Eddie could tell, neither of them had seen the bone change. They had both seen it glowing superhot, and Roland had seen it explode (or had it imploded? to Eddie that seemed closer to what he had seen), but that was all. Or so he believed; Roland, however, sometimes kept his own counsel, and when he decided to play his cards close to the vest, he played them very close indeed, Eddie knew that from bitter experience. He thought of telling them what he had seen—or <i class="calibre3">thought</i> he had seen—and decided to play his own cards tight and close-up, at least for the time being.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Of the jawbone itself there was no sign—not even a splinter.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I did it because a voice spoke in my mind and told me I must,” Roland said. “It was the voice of my father; of <i class="calibre3">all</i> my fathers. When one hears such a voice, not to obey—and at once—is unthinkable. So I was taught. As to what it was, I can’t say ... not now, at least. I only know that the bone has spoken its final word. I have carried it all this way to hear it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Or to see it</i>, Eddie thought, and again: <i class="calibre3">Remember. Remember the rose. And remember the shape of the key.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It almost flash-fried us!” She sounded both tired and exasperated.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “I think it was more like the sort of firework the barons used to sometimes shoot into the sky at their year-end parties. Bright and startling, but not dangerous.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had an idea. “The doubling in your mind, Roland—is it gone? Did it leave when the bone exploded, or whatever it did?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was almost convinced that it had; in the movies he’d seen, such rough shock-therapy almost always worked. But Roland shook his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah shifted in Eddie’s arms. “You said you were beginning to understand.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “I think so, yes. If I’m right, I fear for Jake. Wherever he is, <i class="calibre3">whenever</i> he is, I fear for him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What do you mean?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland got up, went to his roll of hides, and began to spread them out. “Enough stories and excitement for one night. It’s time to sleep. In the morning we’ll follow the bear’s backtrail and see if we can find the portal he was set to guard. I’ll tell you what I know and what I believe has happened—what I believe is happening still—along the way.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    With that he wrapped himself in an old blanket and a new deerskin, rolled away from the fire, and would say no more.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie and Susannah lay down together. When they were sure the gunslinger must be asleep, they made love. Roland heard them going about it as he lay wakeful and heard their quiet after-love talk. Most of it was about him. He lay quietly, open eyes looking into the darkness long after their talk had ceased and their breathing had evened out into a single easy note.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was, he thought, fine to be young and in love. Even in the graveyard which this world had become, it was fine.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Enjoy it while you can,</i> he thought<i class="calibre3">, because there is more death ahead. We have come to a stream of blood. That it will lead us to a river of the same stuff, I have no doubt. And, further along, to an ocean. In this world the graves yawn and none of the dead rest easy.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As dawn began to come up in the east, he closed his eyes. Slept briefly. And dreamed of Jake.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h19"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_18"><b class="calibre4">19</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE ALSO DREAMED—DREAMED he was back in New York, walking along Second Avenue with a book in his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    In this dream it was spring. The air was warm, the city was blooming, and homesickness sobbed within him like a muscle with a fishhook caught deep within it. <i class="calibre3">Enjoy this dream, and make it go on as long as you can,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre3">Savor it ... because this is as close to New York as you’re going to get. You can’t go home, Eddie. That part’s done.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked down at the book and was utterly unsurprised to find it was <i class="calibre3">You Can’t Go Home Again</i>, by Thomas Wolfe. Stamped into the dark red cover were three shapes; key, rose, and door. He stopped for a moment, flipped the book open, and read the first line. <i class="calibre3">The man in black fled across the desert</i>, Wolfe had written, <i class="calibre3">and the gunslinger followed.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie closed it and walked on. It was about nine in the morning, he judged, maybe nine-thirty, and traffic on Second Avenue was light. Taxis honked and wove their way from lane to lane with spring sunshine twinkling off their windshields and bright yellow paintjobs. A bum on the corner of Second and Fifty-second asked him for a handout and Eddie tossed the book with the red cover into his lap. He observed (also without surprise) that the bum was Enrico Balazar. He was sitting cross-legged in front of a magic shop. HOUSE OF CARDS, the sign in the window read, and the display inside showed a tower which had been built of Tarot cards. Standing on top was a model of King Kong. There was a tiny radar-dish growing out of the great ape’s head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie walked on, lazing his way downtown, the street-signs floating past him. He knew where he was going as soon as he saw it: a small shop on the corner of Second and Forty-sixth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Yeah</i>, he thought. A feeling of great relief swept through him. <i class="calibre3">This is the place. The very place.</i> The window was full of hanging meats and cheeses. TOM AND GERRY’S ARTISTIC DELI, the sign read. PARTY PLATTERS OUR SPECIALTY!
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As he stood looking in, someone else he knew came around the corner. It was Jack Andolini, wearing a three-piece suit the color of vanilla ice cream and carrying a black cane in his left hand. Half of his face was gone, lopped off by the claws of the lobstrosities.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Go on in, Eddie,</i> Jack said as he passed<i class="calibre3">. After all, there are other worlds than these and that fuckin train rolls through all of them.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I can’t,</i> Eddie replied. <i class="calibre3">The door is locked</i>. He didn’t know how he knew this, but he did; knew it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Dad-a-chum, dud-a-chee, not to worry, you’ve got the key,</i> Jack said, not looking back. Eddie looked down and saw he did have a key; a primitive-looking thing with three notches like inverted V’s.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That little s-shape at the end of the last notch is the secret</i>, he thought. He stepped under the awning of Tom and Gerry’s Artistic Deli and inserted the key in the lock. It turned easily. He opened the door and stepped through into a huge open field. He looked back over his shoulder and saw the traffic on Second Avenue hurrying by, and then the door slammed shut and fell over. There was nothing behind it. Nothing at all. He turned back to survey his new surroundings, and what he saw filled him with terror at first. The field was a deep scarlet, as if some titanic battle had been fought here and the ground had been drenched with so much blood that it could not all be absorbed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he realized that it was not blood he was looking at, but roses.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That feeling of mingled joy and triumph surged through him again, swelling his heart until he felt it might burst within him. He raised his clenched fists high over his head in a gesture of victory . . . and then froze that way.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The field stretched on for miles, climbing a gentle slope of land, and standing at the horizon was the Dark Tower. It was a pillar of dumb stone rising so high into the sky that he could barely discern its tip. Its base, surrounded by red, shouting roses, was formidable, titanic with weight and size, yet the Tower became oddly graceful as it rose and tapered. The stone of which it had been made was not black, as he had imagined it would be, but soot-colored. Narrow, slitted windows marched about it in a rising spiral; below the windows ran an almost endless flight of stone stairs, circling up and up. The Tower was a dark gray exclamation point planted in the earth and rising above the field of blood-red roses. The sky arched above it was blue, but filled with puffy white clouds like sailing ships. They flowed above and around the top of the Dark Tower in an endless stream.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">How gorgeous it is!</i> Eddie marvelled. <i class="calibre3">How gorgeous and strange!</i> But his feeling of joy and triumph had departed; he was left with a sense of deep malaise and impending doom. He looked about him and realized with sudden horror that he was standing in the shadow of the Tower. No, not just <i class="calibre3">standing</i> in it; buried alive in it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He cried out but his cry was lost in the golden blast of some tremendous horn. It came from the top of the Tower, and seemed to fill the world. As that note of warning held and drew out over the field where he stood, blackness welled from the windows which girdled the Tower. It overspilled them and spread across the sky in flaggy streams which came together and formed a growing blotch of darkness. It did not look like a cloud; it looked like a tumor hanging over the earth. The sky was blotted out. And, he saw, it was not a cloud or a tumor but a <i class="calibre3">shape</i>, some tenebrous, cyclopean <i class="calibre3">shape</i> racing toward the place where he stood. It would do no good to run from that beast coalescing in the sky above the field of roses; it would catch him, clutch him, and bear him away. Into the Dark Tower it would bear him, and the world of light would see him no more.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Rents formed in the darkness and terrible inhuman eyes, each easily the size of the bear Shardik which lay dead in the forest, peered down at him. They were red—red as roses, red as blood.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jack Andolini’s dead voice hammered in his ears: <i class="calibre3">A thousand worlds, Eddie—ten thousand!—and that train rolls through every one</i>. <i class="calibre3">If you can get it started. And if you do get it started, your troubles are only beginning, because this device is a real bastard to shut down.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jack’s voice had become mechanical, chanting. <i class="calibre3">A real bastard to shut down, Eddie boy, you better believe it, this bastard is—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“—SHUTTING DOWN! SHUTDOWN WILL BE COMPLETE IN ONE HOUR AND SIX MINUTES!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    In his dream, Eddie threw his hands up to shield his eyes . . .
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h20"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_19"><b class="calibre4">20</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    . . . AND WOKE, SITTING BOLT upright beside the dead campfire. He was looking at the world from between his own spread fingers. And still that voice rolled on and on, the voice of some heartless SWAT Squad commander bellowing through a bullhorn.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“THERE IS NO DANGER! REPEAT, THERE IS NO DANGER! FIVE SUBNUCLEAR CELLS ARE DORMANT, TWO SUBNUCLEAR CELLS ARE NOW IN SHUTDOWN PHASE, ONE SUBNUCLEAR CELL IS OPERATING AT TWO PER CENT CAPACITY. THESE CELLS ARE OF NO VALUE! REPEAT, THESE CELLS ARE OF NO VALUE! REPORT LOCATION TO NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS, LIMITED! CALL 1-900-44! THE CODE WORD FOR THIS DEVICE IS ‘SHARDIK.’ REWARD IS OFFERED! REPEAT, REWARD IS OFFERED!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The voice fell silent. Eddie saw Roland standing at the edge of the clearing, holding Susannah in the crook of one arm. They were staring toward the sound of the voice, and as the recorded announcement began again, Eddie was finally able to shake off the chill remnants of his nightmare. He got up and joined Roland and Susannah, wondering how many centuries it had been since that announcement, programmed to broadcast only in the event of a total system breakdown, had been recorded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“THIS DEVICE IS SHUTTING DOWN! SHUTDOWN WILL BE COMPLETE IN ONE HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES! THERE IS NO DANGER! REPEAT—”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie touched Susannah’s arm and she looked around. “How long has this been going on?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “About fifteen minutes. You were dead to the w—” She broke off. “Eddie, you look terrible! Are you sick?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. I just had a bad dream.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland was studying him in a way that made Eddie feel uncomfortable. “Sometimes there’s truth in dreams, Eddie. What was yours?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought for a moment, then shook his head. “I don’t remember.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You know, I doubt that.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shrugged and favored Roland with a thin smile. “Doubt away, then—be my guest. And how are you this morning, Roland?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The same,” Roland said. His faded blue eyes still conned Eddie’s face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stop it,” Susannah said. Her voice was brisk, but Eddie caught an undertone of nervousness. “Both of you. I got better things to do than watch you two dance around and kick each other’s shins like a couple of little kids playin Two for Flinching. Specially this morning, with that dead bear trying to yell down the whole world.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger nodded, but kept his eyes on Eddie. “All right . . . but are you sure there’s nothing you want to tell me, Eddie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought about it then—really thought about telling. What he had seen in the fire, what he had seen in his dream. He decided against it. Perhaps it was only the memory of the rose in the fire, and the roses which had blanketed that dream-field in such fabulous profusion. He knew he could not tell these things as his eyes had seen them and his heart had felt them; he could only cheapen them. And, at least for the time being, he wanted to ponder these things alone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">But remember,</i> he told himself again . . . except the voice in his mind didn’t sound much like his own. It seemed deeper, older—the voice of a stranger. <i class="calibre3">Remember the rose . . . and the shape of the key</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I will,” he murmured.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You will what?” Roland asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Tell,” Eddie said. “If anything comes up that seems, you know, really important, I’ll tell you. Both of you. Right now there isn’t. So if we’re going somewhere, Shane, old buddy, let’s saddle up.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shane? Who is this Shane?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll tell you that some other time, too. Meantime, let’s go.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They packed the gear they had brought with them from the old campsite and headed back, Susannah riding in her wheelchair again. Eddie had an idea she wouldn’t be riding in it for long.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    ONCE, BEFORE EDDIE HAD become too interested in the subject of heroin to be interested in much else, he and a couple of friends had driven over to New Jersey to see a couple of speed-metal groups—Anthrax and Megadeth—in concert at the Meadowlands. He believed that Anthrax had been slightly louder than the repeating announcement coming from the fallen bear, but he wasn’t a hundred per cent sure. Roland stopped them while they were still half a mile from the clearing in the woods and tore six small scraps of cloth from his old shirt. They stuffed them in their ears and then went on. Even the cloth didn’t do much to deaden the steady blast of sound.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“THIS DEVICE IS SHUTTING DOWN!”</i> the bear blared as they stepped into the clearing again. It lay as it had lain, at the foot of the tree Eddie had climbed, a fallen Colossus with its legs apart and its knees in the air, like a furry female giant who had died trying to give birth. “<i class="calibre3">SHUTDOWN WILL BE COMPLETE IN FORTY-SEVEN MINUTES! THERE IS NO DANGER—”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yes, there is, Eddie thought, picking up the scattered hides which had not been shredded in either the bear’s attack or its flailing death-throes. <i class="calibre3">Plenty</i> of danger. To my fucking <i class="calibre3">ears.</i> He picked up Roland’s gunbelt and silently handed it over. The chunk of wood he had been working on lay nearby; he grabbed it and tucked it into the pocket in the back of Susannah’s wheelchair as the gunslinger slowly buckled the wide leather belt around his waist and cinched the rawhide tiedown.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<b class="calibre4">—</b><i class="calibre3">IN SHUTDOWN PHASE, ONE SUBNUCLEAR CELL OPERATING AT ONE PER CENT CAPACITY. THESE CELLS</i>—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah followed Eddie, holding in her lap a carryall bag she had sewn herself. As Eddie handed her the hides, she stuffed them into the bag. When all of them were stored away, Roland tapped Eddie on the arm and handed him a shoulderpack. What it contained mostly was deermeat, heavily salted from a natural lick Roland had found about three miles up the little creek. The gunslinger had already donned a similar pack. His purse—restocked and once again bulging with all sorts of odds and ends—hung from his other shoulder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A strange, home-made harness with a seat of stitched deerskin dangled from a nearby branch. Roland plucked it off, studied it for a moment, and then draped it over his back and knotted the straps below his chest. Susannah made a sour face at this, and Roland saw it. He did not try to speak—this close to the bear, he couldn’t have made himself heard even by shouting at the top of his voice—but he shrugged sympathetically and spread his hands: <i class="calibre3">You know we’ll need it</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She shrugged back. <i class="calibre3">I know . . . but that doesn’t mean I like it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger pointed across the clearing. A pair of leaning, splintered spruce trees marked the place where Shardik, who had once been known as Mir in these parts, had entered the clearing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie leaned toward Susannah, made a circle with his thumb and forefinger, then raised his eyebrows interrogatively. <i class="calibre3">Okay?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She nodded, then pressed the heels of her palms against her ears. <i class="calibre3">Okay—but let’s get out of here before I go deaf.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The three of them moved across the clearing, Eddie pushing Susannah, who held the bag of hides in her lap. The pocket in the back of her wheelchair was stuffed with other items; the piece of wood with the slingshot still mostly hidden inside it was only one of them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    From behind them the bear continued to roar out its final communication to the world, telling them shutdown would be complete in forty minutes. Eddie couldn’t wait. The broken spruces leaned in toward each other, forming a rude gate, and Eddie thought: <i class="calibre3">This is where the quest for Roland’s Dark Tower really begins, at least for us.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought of his dream again—the spiraling windows issuing their unfurling flags of darkness, flags which spread over the field of roses like a stain—and as they passed beneath the leaning trees, a deep shudder gripped him.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h22"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_21"><b class="calibre4">22</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THEY WERE ABLE TO use the wheelchair longer than Roland had expected. The firs of this forest were very old, and their spreading branches had created a deep carpet of needles which discouraged most undergrowth. Susannah’s arms were strong—stronger than Eddie’s, although Roland did not think that would be true much longer—and she wheeled herself along easily over the level, shady forest floor. When they came to one of the trees the bear had pushed over, Roland lifted her out of the chair and Eddie boosted it over the obstacle.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    From behind them, only a little deadened by distance, the bear told them, at the top of its mechanical voice, that the capacity of its last operating nuclear subcell was now negligible.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I hope you keep that damn harness lying empty over your shoulders all day!” Susannah shouted at the gunslinger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland agreed, but less than fifteen minutes later the land began to slope downward and this old section of the forest began to be invaded with smaller, younger trees: birch, alder, and a few stunted maples scrabbling grimly in the soil for purchase. The carpet of needles thinned and the wheels of Susannah’s chair began to catch in the low, tough bushes which grew in the alleys between the trees. Their thin branches boinged and rattled in the stainless steel spokes. Eddie threw his weight against the handles and they were able to go on for another quarter of a mile that way. Then the slope began to grow more steep, and the ground underfoot became mushy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Time for a pig-back, lady,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let’s try the chair a little longer, what do you say? Going might get easier—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “If you try that hill, you’ll . . . what did you call it, Eddie? . . . do a dugout?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shook his head, grinning. “It’s called doing a doughnut, Roland. A term from my misspent sidewalk-surfing days.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Whatever you call it, it means landing on your head. Come on, Susannah. Up you come.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I hate being a cripple,” Susannah said crossly, but allowed Eddie to hoist her out of the chair and worked with him to seat herself firmly in the harness Roland wore on his back. Once she was in place, she touched the butt of Roland’s pistol. “Y’all want this baby?” she asked Eddie.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He shook his head. “You’re faster. And you know it, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She grunted and adjusted the belt, settling the gun-butt so it was easily accessible to her right hand. “I’m slowing you boys down and I know that . . . but if we ever make it to some good old two-lane blacktop, I’ll leave the both of you kneelin in the blocks.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t doubt it,” Roland said . . . and then cocked his head. The woods had fallen silent.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Br’er Bear has finally given up,” Susannah said. “Praise God.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I thought it still had seven minutes to go,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland adjusted the straps of the harness. “Its clock must have started running a little slow during the last five or six hundred years.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You really think it was that old, Roland?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “At least. And now it’s passed . . . the last of the Twelve Guardians, for all we know.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah, ask me if I give a shit,” Eddie replied, and Susannah laughed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you comfortable?” Roland asked her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. My butt hurts already, but go on. Just try not to drop me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded and started down the slope. Eddie followed, pushing the empty chair and trying not to bang it too badly on the rocks which had begun to jut out of the ground like big white knuckles. Now that the bear had finally shut up, he thought the forest seemed much too quiet—it almost made him feel like a character in one of those hokey old jungle movies about cannibals and giant apes.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h23"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_22"><b class="calibre4">23</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE BEAR’S BACKTRAIL WAS easy to find but tougher to follow. Five miles or so out of the clearing, it led them through a low, boggy area that was not quite a swamp. By the time the ground began to rise and firm up a little again, Roland’s faded jeans were soaked to the knees and he was breathing in long, steady rasps. Still, he was in slightly better shape than Eddie, who had found wrestling Susannah’s wheelchair through the muck and standing water hard going.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Time to rest and eat something,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh boy, gimme eats,” Eddie puffed. He helped Susannah out of the harness and set her down on the bole of a fallen tree with claw-marks slashed into its trunk in long diagonal grooves. Then he half-sat, half-collapsed next to her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You got my wheelchair pretty muddy, white boy,” Susannah said. “It’s all goan be in my repote.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He cocked an eyebrow at her. “Next carwash we come to, I’ll push you through myself. I’ll even Turtle-wax the goddamn thing. Okay?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She smiled. “You got a date, handsome.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had one of Roland’s waterskins cinched around his waist. He tapped it. “Okay?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said. “Not too much now; a little more for all of us before we set out again. That way no one takes a cramp.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland, Eagle Scout of Oz,” Eddie said, and giggled as he unslung the waterskin.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What is this Oz?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A make-believe place in a movie,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oz was a lot more than that. My brother Henry used to read me the stories once in a while. I’ll tell you one some night, Roland.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That would be fine,” the gunslinger replied seriously. “I am hungry to know more of your world.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oz isn’t our world, though. Like Susannah said, it’s a make-believe place—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland handed them chunks of meat which had been wrapped in broad leaves of some sort. “The quickest way to learn about a new place is to know what it dreams of. I would hear of this Oz.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay, that’s a date, too. Suze can tell you the one about Dorothy and Toto and the Tin Woodman, and I’ll tell you all the rest.” He bit into his piece of meat and rolled his eyes approvingly. It had taken the flavor of the leaves in which it had been rolled, and was delicious. Eddie wolfed his ration, stomach gurgling busily all the while. Now that he was getting his breath back, he felt good—great, in fact. His body was growing a solid sheath of muscle, and every part of it felt at peace with every other part.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Don’t worry, he</i> thought<i class="calibre3">. Everything will be arguing again by tonight. I think he’s gonna push on until I’m ready to drop in my tracks.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah ate more delicately, chasing every second or third bite with a little sip of water, turning the meat in her hands, eating from the outside in. “Finish what you started last night,” she invited Roland. “You said you thought you understood these conflicting memories of yours.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “Yes. I think both memories are true. One is a little truer than the other, but that does not <i class="calibre3">negate</i> the truth of that other.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Makes no sense to me,” Eddie said. “Either this boy Jake was at the way station or he wasn’t, Roland.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It is a paradox—something that is and isn’t at the same time. Until it’s resolved, I will continue divided. That’s bad enough, but the basic split is widening. I can feel that happening. It is . . . unspeakable.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What do you think caused it?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I told you the boy was pushed in front of a car. <i class="calibre3">Pushed.</i> Now, who do we know who liked to push people in front of things?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Understanding dawned in her face. “Jack Mort. Do you mean he was the one who pushed this boy into the street?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But you said the man in black did it,” Eddie objected. “Your buddy Walter. You said that the boy <i class="calibre3">saw</i> him—a man who looked like a priest. Didn’t the kid even hear him say he was? ‘Let me through, I’m a priest,’ something like that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, Walter was there. They were <i class="calibre3">both</i> there, and they both pushed Jake.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Somebody bring the Thorazine and the straitjacket,” Eddie called. “Roland just went over the high side.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland paid no attention to this; he was coming to understand that Eddie’s jokes and clowning were his way of dealing with stress. Cuthbert had not been much different . . . as Susannah was, in her way, not so different from Alain. “What exasperates me about all of this,” he said, “is that I should have <i class="calibre3">known</i>. I was <i class="calibre3">in</i> Jack Mort, after all, and I had access to his thoughts, just as I had access to yours, Eddie, and yours, Susannah. I <i class="calibre3">saw</i> Jake while was in Mort. I saw him through Mort’s eyes, <i class="calibre3">and I knew Mort planned</i> to <i class="calibre3">push him.</i> Not only that; I <i class="calibre3">stopped</i> him from doing it. All I had to do was enter his body. Not that he knew that was what it was; he was concentrating so hard on what he planned to do that he actually thought I was a fly landing on his neck.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie began to understand. “If Jake wasn’t pushed into the street, he never died. And if he never died, he never came into this world. And if he never came into this world, you never met him at the way station. Right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Right. The thought even crossed my mind that if Jack Mort meant to kill the boy, I would have to stand aside and let him do it. To avoid creating the very paradox that is tearing me apart. But I couldn’t do that. I . . I . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You couldn’t kill this kid twice, could you?” Eddie asked softly. “Every time I just about make up my mind that you’re as mechanical as that bear, you surprise me with something that actually seems human. Goddam”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Quit it, Eddie,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie took a look at the gunslinger’s slightly lowered face and grimaced. “Sorry, Roland. My mother used to say that my mouth had a bad habit of running away with my mind.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s all right. I had a friend who was the same way”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Cuthbert?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. He looked at his diminished right hand for a long moment, then clenched it into a painful fist, sighed, and looked up at them again. Somewhere, deeper in the forest, a lark sang sweetly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Here is what I believe. If I had not entered Jack Mort when I did, he <i class="calibre3">still</i> wouldn’t have pushed Jake that day. Not then. Why not? <i class="calibre3">Ka-tet</i>. Simply that. For the first time since the last of the friends with whom I set forth on this quest died, I have found myself once again at the center of <i class="calibre3">ka-tet.</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Quartet?” Eddie asked doubtfully.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger shook his head. “<i class="calibre3">Ka—</i>the word you think of as ‘destiny,’ Eddie, although the actual meaning is much more complex and hard to define, as is almost always the case with words of the High Speech. And <i class="calibre3">tet</i>, which means a group of people with the same interests and goals. We three are a <i class="calibre3">tet</i>, for instance. <i class="calibre3">Ka-tet</i> is the place where many lives are joined by fate.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Like in <i class="calibre3">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</i>,” Susannah murmured.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s that?” Roland asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A story about some people who die together when the bridge they’re crossing collapses. It’s famous in our world.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded his understanding. “In this case, <i class="calibre3">ka-tet</i> bound Jake, Walter, Jack Mort, and me. There was no trap, as I first suspected when I realized who Jack Mort meant to be his next victim, because <i class="calibre3">ka-tet</i> cannot be changed or bent to the will of any one person. But <i class="calibre3">ka-tet</i> can be <i class="calibre3">seen, known</i>, and <i class="calibre3">understood</i>. Walter saw, and Walter knew.” The gunslinger struck his thigh with his fist and exclaimed bitterly, “How he must have been laughing inside when I finally caught up to him!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let’s go back to what would have happened if you hadn’t messed up Jack Mort’s plans on the day he was following Jake,” Eddie said. “You’re saying that if <i class="calibre3">you</i> hadn’t stopped Mort, someone or something else would have. Is that right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes—because it wasn’t the <i class="calibre3">right</i> day for Jake to die. It was <i class="calibre3">close</i> to the right day, but not <i class="calibre3">the</i> right day. I felt that, too. Perhaps, just before he did it, Mort would have seen someone watching him. Or a perfect stranger would have intervened. Or—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Or a cop,” Susannah said. “He might have seen a cop in the wrong place and at the wrong time.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. The exact reason—the agent of <i class="calibre3">ka-tet—</i>doesn’t matter. I know from firsthand experience that Mort was as wily as an old fox. If he sensed any slightest thing wrong, he would have called it off and waited for another day.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I know something else, as well. He hunted in disguise. On the day he dropped the brick on Detta Holmes’s head, he was wearing a knitted cap and an old sweater several sizes too big for him. He wanted to look like a wine-bibber, because he pushed the brick from a building where a large number of sots kept their dens. You see?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “On the day, years later, when he pushed you in front of the train, Susannah, he was dressed as a construction worker. He was wearing a big yellow helmet he thought of as a ‘hardhat’ and a fake moustache. On the day when he actually <i class="calibre3">would</i> have pushed Jake into traffic, causing his death, <i class="calibre3">he would have been dressed as a priest.</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jesus,” Susannah nearly whispered. “The man who pushed him in New York was Jack Mort, and the man he saw at the way station was this fella you were chasing—Walter.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And the little boy thought they were the same man because they were both wearing the same kind of black robe?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “There was even a physical resemblance between Walter and Jack Mort. Not as if they were brothers, I don’t mean that, but both were tall men with dark hair and very pale complexions. And given the fact that Jake was dying when he got his only good look at Mort and was in a strange place and scared almost witless when he got his only good look at Walter, I think his mistake was both understandable and forgivable. If there’s a horse’s ass in this picture, it’s me, for not realizing the truth sooner.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Would Mort have known he was being used?” Eddie asked. Thinking back to his own experiences and wild thoughts when Roland had invaded his mind, he didn’t see how Mort could not know . . . but Roland was shaking his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Walter would have been extremely subtle. Mort would have thought the priest disguise his own idea . . . or so I believe. He would not have recognized the voice of an intruder—of Walter—whispering deep within his mind, telling him what to do.” “Jack Mort,” Eddie marvelled. “It was Jack Mort all the time.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes . . . with assistance from Walter. And so I ended up saving Jake’s life after all. When I made Mort jump from the subway platform in front of the train, I changed everything.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah asked, “If this Walter was able to enter our world—through his own private door, maybe—whenever he wanted, couldn’t he have used someone else to push your little boy? If he could suggest to Mort that he dress up like a priest, then he could make somebody else do it . . . What, Eddie? Why are you shaking your head?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because I don’t think Walter would want that to happen. What Walter wanted is what <i class="calibre3">is</i> happening . . . for Roland to be losing his mind, bit by bit. Isn’t that right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Walter couldn’t have done it that way even if he <i class="calibre3">had</i> wanted to,” Eddie added, “because he was dead long before Roland found the doors on the beach. When Roland went through that last one and into Jack Mort’s head, ole Walt’s messin-around days were done.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah thought about this, then nodded her head. “I see . . . <i class="calibre3">I think</i>. This time-travel business is some confusing shit, isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland began to pick up his goods and strap them back into place. “Time we were moving on.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie stood up and shrugged into his pack. “You can take comfort from one thing, at least,” he told Roland. “You—or this <i class="calibre3">ka-tet</i> business—were able to save the kid after all.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland had been knotting the harness-strings at his chest. Now he looked up, and the blazing clarity of his eyes made Eddie flinch backward. “Have I?” he asked harshly. “Have I really? I’m going insane an inch at a time, trying to live with two versions of the same reality. I had hoped at first that one or the other would begin to fade away, but that’s not happening. In fact, the exact opposite is happening: those two realities are growing louder and louder in my head, clamoring at each other like opposing factions which must soon go to war. So tell me this, Eddie: How do you suppose <i class="calibre3">Jake</i> feels? <i class="calibre3">How do you suppose it feels to know you are dead in one world and alive in another?</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The lark sang again, but none of them noticed. Eddie stared into the faded blue eyes blazing out of Roland’s pale face and could not think of a thing to say.

  <div class="tx">
    THEY CAMPED ABOUT FIFTEEN miles due east of the dead bear that night, slept the sleep of the completely exhausted (even Roland slept the night through, although his dreams were nightmare carnival-rides), and were up the next morning at sunrise. Eddie kindled a small fire without speaking, and glanced at Susannah as a pistol-shot rang out in the woods nearby.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Breakfast,” she said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland returned three minutes later with a hide slung over one shoulder. On it lay the freshly gutted corpse of a rabbit. Susannah cooked it. They ate and moved on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie kept trying to imagine what it would be like to have a memory of your own death. On that one he kept coming up short.
  </div>

  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_24"><b class="calibre4">25</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    SHORTLY AFTER NOON THEY entered an area where most of the trees had been pulled over and the bushes mashed flat—it looked as though a cyclone had touched down here many years before, creating a wide and dismal alley of destruction.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’re close to the place we want to find,” Roland said. “He pulled down everything to clear the sightlines. Our friend the bear wanted no surprises. He was big, but not complacent.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Has it left <i class="calibre3">us</i> any surprises?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He may have done so.” Roland smiled a little and touched Eddie on the shoulder. “But there’s this—they’ll be <i class="calibre3">old</i> surprises.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Their progress through this zone of destruction was slow. Most of the fallen trees were very old—many had almost rejoined the soil from which they had sprung—but they still made enough of a tangle to create a formidable obstacle course. It would have been difficult enough if all three of them had been able-bodied; with Susannah strapped to the gunslinger’s back in her harness, it became an exercise in aggravation and endurance.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The flattened trees and jumbles of underbrush served to obscure the bear’s backtrail, and that also worked to slow their speed. Until midday they had followed claw-marks as clear as trail-blazes on the trees. Here, however, near its starting point, the bear’s rage had not been full-blown, and these handy signs of its passage disappeared. Roland moved slowly, looking for droppings in the bushes and tufts of hair on the tree-trunks over which the bear had climbed. It took all afternoon to cross three miles of this decayed jumble.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had just decided they were going to lose the light and would have to camp in these creepy surroundings when they came to a thin skirt of alders. Beyond it, he could hear a stream babbling noisily over a bed of stones. Behind them, the setting sun was radiating spokes of sullen red light across the jumbled ground they had just crossed, turning the fallen trees into crisscrossing black shapes like Chinese ideograms.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland called a halt and eased Susannah down. He stretched his back, twisting it this way and that with his hands on his hips.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That it for the night?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “Give Eddie your gun, Susannah.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She did as he said, looking at him questioningly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, Eddie. The place we want is on the other side of those trees. We’ll have a look. We might do a little work, as well.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What makes you think—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Open your ears.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie listened and realized he heard machinery. He further realized that he had been hearing it for some time now. “I don’t want to leave Susannah.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’re not going far and she has a good loud voice. Besides, if there’s danger, it’s ahead—we’ll be between it and her.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked down at Susannah.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go on—just make sure you’re back soon.” She looked back the way they had come with thoughtful eyes. “I don’t know if there’s ha’ants here or not, but it <i class="calibre3">feels</i> like there are.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’ll be back before dark,” Roland promised. He started toward the screen of alders, and after a moment, Eddie followed him.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h26"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_25"><b class="calibre4">26</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    FIFTEEN YARDS INTO THE trees, Eddie realized that they were following a path, one the bear had probably made for itself over the years. The alders bent above them in a tunnel. The sounds were louder now, and he began to sort them out. One was a low, deep, humming noise. He could feel it in his feet—a faint vibration, as if some large piece of machinery was running in the earth. Above it, closer and more urgent, were crisscrossing sounds like bright scratches—squeals, squeaks, chitterings.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland placed his mouth against Eddie’s ear and said, “I think there’s little danger if we’re quiet.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They moved on another five yards and then Roland stopped again. He drew his gun and used the barrel to brush aside a branch which hung heavy with sunset-tinted leaves. Eddie looked through this small opening and into the clearing where the bear had lived for so long—the base of operations from which he had set forth on his many expeditions of pillage and terror.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no undergrowth here; the ground had been beaten bald long since. A stream emerged from the base of a rock wall about fifty feet high and ran through the arrowhead-shaped clearing. On their side of the stream, backed up against the wall, was a metal box about nine feet high. Its roof was curved, and it reminded Eddie of a subway entrance. The front was painted in diagonal yellow and black stripes. The earth which floored the clearing was not black, like the topsoil in the forest, but a strange powdery gray. It was littered with bones, and after a moment Eddie realized that what he had taken for gray soil was more bones, bones so old they were crumbling back to dust.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Things were moving in the dirt—the things making the squealing, chittering noises. Four . . . no, five of them. Small metal devices, the largest about the size of a Collie pup. They were robots, Eddie realized, or something <i class="calibre3">like</i> robots. They were similar to each other and to the bear they had undoubtedly served in one way only—atop each of them, a tiny radar-dish turned rapidly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">More thinking caps</i>, Eddie thought. <i class="calibre3">My God, what kind of world is this, anyway?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The largest of these devices looked a little like the Tonka tractor Eddie had gotten for his sixth or seventh birthday; its treads churned up tiny gray clouds of bone-dust as it rolled along. Another looked like a stainless steel rat. A third appeared to be a snake constructed of jointed steel segments—it writhed and humped its way along. They formed a rough circle on the far side of the stream, going around and around on a deep course they had carved in the ground. Looking at them made Eddie think of cartoons he had seen in the stacks of old <i class="calibre3">Saturday Evening</i> <i class="calibre3">Post</i> magazines his mother had for some reason saved and stored in the front hall of their apartment. In the cartoons, worried, cigarette-smoking men paced ruts in the carpet while they awaited for their wives to give birth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As his eyes grew used to the simple geography of the clearing, Eddie saw that there were a great many more than five of these assorted freaks. There were at least a dozen others that he could see and probably more hidden behind the bony remains of the bear’s old kills. The difference was that the others weren’t moving. The members of the bear’s mechanical retinue had died, one by one, over the long years until just this little group of five were left . . . and they did not sound very healthy, with their squeaks and squalls and rusty chitterings. The snake in particular had a hesitant, crippled look as it followed the mechanical rat around and around the circle. Every now and then the device which followed the snake—a steel block that walked on stubby mechanical legs—would catch up with it and give the snake a nudge, as if telling it to hurry the fuck up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie wondered what their job had been. Surely not protection; the bear had been built to protect itself, and Eddie guessed that if old Shardik had come upon the three of them while still in its prime, it would have chewed them up and spat them out in short order. Perhaps these little robots had been its maintenance crew, or scouts, or messengers. He guessed that they could be dangerous, but only in their own defense . . . or their master’s. They did not seem warlike.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was, in fact, something pitiful about them. Most of the crew was now defunct, their master was gone, and Eddie believed they knew it somehow. It was not menace they projected but a strange, inhuman sadness. Old and almost worn out, they paced and rolled and wriggled their anxious way around the worry-track they had dug in this godforsaken clearing, and it almost seemed to Eddie that he could read the confused run of their thoughts; <i class="calibre3">Oh dear, oh dear, what now? What is our purpose, now that He is gone? And who will take care of us, now that He is gone? Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear</i> . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie felt a tug on the back of his leg and came very close to screaming in fear and surprise. He wheeled, cocking Roland’s gun, and saw Susannah looking up at him with wide eyes. Eddie let out a long breath and dropped the hammer carefully back to its resting position. He knelt, put his hands on Susannah’s shoulders, kissed her cheek, then whispered in her ear: “I came really close to putting a bullet in your silly head—what are you doing here?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wanted to see,” she whispered back, looking not even slightly abashed. Her eyes shifted to Roland as he also hunkered beside her. “Besides, it was spooky back there by myself.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She had sustained a number of small scratches crawling after them through the brush, but Roland had to admit to himself that she could be as quiet as a ghost when she wanted to be; he hadn’t heard a thing. He took a rag (the last remnant of his old shirt) from his back pocket and wiped the little trickles of blood from her arms. He examined his work for a moment and then dabbed at a small nick on her forehead as well. “Have your look, then,” he said. His voice was hardly more than the movement of his lips. “I guess you earned it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He used one hand to open a sightline at her level in the hock and greenberry bushes, then waited while she stared raptly into the clearing. At last she pulled back and Roland allowed the bushes to close again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I feel sorry for them,” she whispered. “Isn’t that crazy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not at all,” Roland whispered back. “They are creatures of great sadness, I think, in their own strange way. Eddie is going to put them out of their misery.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie began to shake his head at once.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, you are . . . unless you want to hunker here in what you call ‘the toolies’ all night. Go for the hats. The little twirling things.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What if I <i class="calibre3">miss</i>?” Eddie whispered at him furiously.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shrugged.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie stood up and reluctantly cocked the gunslinger’s revolver again. He looked through the bushes at the circling servomechanisms, going around and around in their lonely, useless orbit. <i class="calibre3">It’ll be like shooting puppies</i>, he thought glumly. Then he saw one of them—it was the thing that looked like a walking box—extrude an ugly-looking pincer device from its middle and clamp it for a moment on the snake. The snake made a surprised buzzing sound and leaped ahead. The walking box withdrew its pincer.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Well</i> . . . <i class="calibre3">maybe not</i> exactly <i class="calibre3">like shooting puppies,</i> Eddie decided. He glanced at Roland again. Roland looked back expressionlessly, arms folded across his chest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You pick some goddam strange times to keep school, buddy.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie thought of Susannah, first shooting the bear in the ass, then blowing its sensor device to smithereens as it bore down on her and Roland, and felt a little ashamed of himself. And there was more: part of him wanted to go for it, just as part of him had <i class="calibre3">wanted</i> to go up against Balazar and his crew of plug-uglies in The Leaning Tower. The compulsion was probably sick, but that didn’t change its basic attraction: <i class="calibre3">Let’s see who walks away . . let’s just see</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yeah, that was pretty sick, all right.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Pretend it’s just a shooting gallery, and you want to win your honey a stuffed dog</i>, he thought. Or a <i class="calibre3">stuffed bear</i>. He drew a bead on the walking box and then looked around impatiently when Roland touched his shoulder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Say your lesson, Eddie. And be true.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie hissed impatiently through his teeth, angry at the distraction, but Roland’s eyes didn’t flinch and so he drew a deep breath and tried to clear everything from his mind: the squeaks and squalls of equipment that had been running too long, the aches and pains in his body, the knowledge that Susannah was here, propped up on the heels of her hands, watching, the <i class="calibre3">further</i> knowledge that she was closest to the ground, and if he missed one of the gadgets out there, she would be the handiest target if it decided to retaliate.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “‘I do not shoot with my hand; he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That was a joke, he thought; he wouldn’t know his old man if he passed him on the street. But he could feel the words doing their work, clearing his mind and settling his nerves. He didn’t know if he was the stuff of which gunslingers were made—the idea seemed fabulously unlikely to him, even though he knew he had managed to hold up his end pretty well during the shootout at Balazar’s nightclub—but he <i class="calibre3">did</i> know that part of him liked the coldness that fell over him when he spoke the words of the old, old catechism the gunslinger had taught them; the coldness and the way things seemed to stand forth with their own breathless clarity. There was another part of him which understood that this was just another deadly drug, not much different from the heroin which had killed Henry and almost killed him, but that did not alter the thin, tight pleasure of the moment. It drummed in him like taut cables vibrating in a high wind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I do not aim with my hand; he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I aim with my eye.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘I do not kill with my gun; he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then, without knowing he meant to do it, he stepped out of the trees and spoke to the trundling robots on the far side of the clearing:
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“ ‘I kill with my heart.’ ”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They stopped their endless circling. One of them let out a high buzz that might have been alarm or a warning. The radar-dishes, each no bigger than half a Hershey bar, turned toward the sound of his voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie began to fire.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The sensors exploded like clay pigeons, one after the other. Pity was gone from Eddie’s heart; there was only that coldness, and the knowledge that he would not stop, could not stop, until the job was done.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Thunder filled the twilit clearing and bounced back from the splintery rock wall at its wide end. The steel snake did two cartwheels and lay twitching in the dust. The biggest mechanism—the one that had reminded Eddie of his childhood Tonka tractor—tried to flee. Eddie blew its radar-dish to kingdom come as it made a herky-jerky run at the side of the rut. It fell on its squarish nose with thin blue flames squirting out of the steel sockets which held its glass eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The only sensor he missed was the one on the stainless steel rat; that shot caromed off its metal back with a high mosquito whine. It surged out of the rut, made a half-circle around the box-shaped thing which had been following the snake, and charged across the clearing at surprising speed. It was making an angry clittering sound, and as it closed the distance, Eddie could see it had a mouth lined with long, sharp points. They did not look like teeth; they looked like sewing-machine needles, blurring up and down. No, he guessed these things were really not much like puppies, after all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Take it, Roland!</i>” he shouted desperately, but when he snatched a quick look around he saw that Roland was still standing with his arms crossed on his chest, his expression serene and distant. He might have been thinking of chess problems or old love-letters.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The dish on the rat’s back suddenly locked down. It changed direction slightly and buzzed straight toward Susannah Dean.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">One bullet left,</i> Eddie thought<i class="calibre3">. If I miss, it’ll take her face off</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Instead of shooting, he stepped forward and kicked the rat as hard as he could. He had replaced his shoes with a pair of deerskin moccasins, and he felt the jolt all the way up to his knee. The rat gave a rusty, ratcheting squeal, tumbled over and over in the dirt, and came to rest on its back. Eddie could see what looked like a dozen stubby mechanical legs pistoning up and down. Each was tipped with a sharp steel claw. These claws twirled around and around on gimbals the size of pencil-erasers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A steel rod poked out of the robot’s midsection and flipped the gadget upright again. Eddie brought Roland’s revolver down, ignoring a momentary impulse to steady it with his free hand. That might be the way cops in his own world were taught to shoot, but it wasn’t the way it was done here. <i class="calibre3">When you forget the gun is there, when it feels like you’re shooting with your finger</i>, Roland had told them, <i class="calibre3">then you’ll be somewhere near home</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie pulled the trigger. The tiny radar-dish, which had begun to turn again in an effort to find the enemies, disappeared in a blue flash. The rat made a choked noise—<i class="calibre3">Cloop!</i>—and fell dead on its side.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie turned with his heart jackhammering in his chest. He couldn’t remember being this furious since he realized that Roland meant to keep him in his world until his goddamned Tower was won or lost . . . probably until they were all worm-chow, in other words.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He levelled the empty gun at Roland’s heart and spoke in a thick voice he hardly recognized as his own. “If there was a round left in this, you could stop worrying about your fucking Tower right now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stop it, Eddie!” Susannah said sharply.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at her. “It was going for <i class="calibre3">you</i>, Susannah, and it meant to turn you into ground chuck.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But it didn’t get me. <i class="calibre3">You</i> got <i class="calibre3">it</i>, Eddie. You got it. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No thanks to him.” Eddie made as if to re-holster the gun and then realized, to his further disgust, that he had nothing to put it in. Susannah was wearing the holster. “Him and his lessons. Him and his goddam <i class="calibre3">lessons.</i>” He turned to Roland. “I tell you, for two cents—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland’s mildly interested expression suddenly changed. His eyes shifted to a point over Eddie’s left shoulder. <i class="calibre3">“DOWN!”</i> he shouted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie didn’t ask questions. His rage and confusion were wiped from his mind immediately. He dropped, and as he did, he saw the gunslinger’s left hand blur down to his side. <i class="calibre3">My God</i>, he thought, still falling, he <i class="calibre3">CAN’T be that fast,</i> no one <i class="calibre3">can be that fast, I’m not bad but Susannah makes me look slow and he makes Susannah look like a turtle trying to walk uphill on a piece of glass—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Something passed just over his head, something that squealed at him in mechanical rage and pulled out a tuft of his hair. Then the gunslinger was shooting from the hip, three fast shots like thunder-cracks, and the squealing stopped. A creature which looked to Eddie like a large mechanical bat thudded to earth between the place where Eddie now lay and the one where Susannah knelt beside Roland. One of its jointed, rust-speckled wings thumped the ground once, weakly, as if angry at the missed chance, and then became still.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland crossed to Eddie, walking easy in his old sprung boots. He extended a hand. Eddie took it and let Roland help him to his feet. The wind had been knocked out of him and he found he couldn’t talk. <i class="calibre3">Probably just as well . . . seems like every time I open my mouth I stick my goddam foot into it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie! You all right?” Susannah was crossing the clearing to where he stood with his head bent and his hands planted on his upper thighs, trying to breathe.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah.” The word came out in a croak. He straightened up with an effort. “Just got a little haircut.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It was in a tree,” Roland said mildly. “I didn’t see it myself, at first. The light gets tricky this time of day.” He paused and then went on in that same mild voice: “She was never in any danger, Eddie.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie nodded his head. Roland, he now realized, could almost have eaten a hamburger and drunk a milkshake before beginning his draw. He was that fast.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right. Let’s just say I disapprove of your teaching techniques, okay? I’m not going to apologize, though, so if you’re waiting for one, you can stop now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland bent, picked Susannah up, and began to brush her off. He did this with a kind of impartial affection, like a mother brushing off her toddler after she has taken one of her necessary tumbles in the dust of the back yard. “Your apology is not expected or necessary,” he said. “Susannah and I had a conversation similar to this one two days ago. Didn’t we, Susannah?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She nodded. “Roland’s of the opinion that apprentice gunslingers who won’t bite the hand that feeds them from time to time need a good kick in the slats.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked around at the wreckage and slowly began to beat the bone-dust out of his pants and shirt. “What if I told you I don’t want to <i class="calibre3">be</i> a gunslinger, Roland old buddy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’d say that what you want doesn’t much matter.” Roland was looking at the metal kiosk which stood against the rock wall, and seemed to have lost interest in the conversation. Eddie had seen this before. When the conversation turned to questions of should-be, could-be, or oughtta-be, Roland almost always lost interest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Ka</i>?” Eddie asked, with a trace of his old bitterness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s right. <i class="calibre3">Ka.</i>” Roland walked over to the kiosk and passed a hand along the yellow and black stripes which ran down its front. “We have found one of the twelve portals which ring the edge of the world . . . one of the six paths to the Dark Tower.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And that is also <i class="calibre3">ka.”</i>

  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE WENT BACK FOR Susannah’s wheelchair. No one had to ask him to do this; he wanted some time alone, to get himself back under control. Now that the shooting was over, every muscle in his body seemed to have picked up its own little thrumming tremor. He did not want either of them to see him this way—not because they might misread it as fear, but because one or both might know it for what it really was: excitement overload. He had liked it. Even when you added in the bat which had almost scalped him, he had liked it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That’s bullshit, buddy. And you know it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The trouble was, he <i class="calibre3">didn’t</i> know it. He had come face to face with something Susannah had found out for herself after shooting the bear: he could <i class="calibre3">talk</i> about how he didn’t want to be a gunslinger, how he didn’t want to be tramping around this crazy world where the three of them seemed to be the only human life, that what he really wanted more than anything else was to be standing on the corner of Broadway and Forty-second Street, popping his fingers, munching a chili-dog, and listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival blast out of his Walkman earphones as he watched the girls go by, those ultimately sexy New York girls with their pouty go-to-hell mouths and their long legs in short skirts. He could talk about those things until he was blue in the face, but his heart knew other things. It knew that he had <i class="calibre3">enjoyed</i> blowing the electronic menagerie back to glory, at least while the game was on and Roland’s gun was his own private hand-held thunderstorm. He had <i class="calibre3">enjoyed</i> kicking the robot rat, even though it had hurt his foot and even though he had been scared shitless. In some weird way, that part—the being scared part—actually seemed to add to the enjoyment.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    All that was bad enough, but his heart knew something even worse: that if a door leading back to New York appeared in front of him right now, he might not walk through it. Not, at least, until he had seen the Dark Tower for himself. He was beginning to believe that Roland’s illness was a communicable disease.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As he wrestled Susannah’s chair through the tangle of junk-alders, cursing the branches that whipped at his face and tried to poke his eyes out, Eddie found himself able to admit at least some of these things, and the admission cooled his blood a little. <i class="calibre3">I want to see if it looks the way it did in my dream, he thought. To see something like that . . . that would be really fantastic.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And another voice spoke up inside. <i class="calibre3">I’ll bet his other friends—the ones with the names that sound like they came straight from the Round Table in King Arthur’s court—I’ll bet they felt the same way, Eddie. And they’re all dead. Every one of them.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He recognized that voice, like it or not. It belonged to Henry, and that made it a hard voice not to hear.

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND, WITH SUSANNAH BALANCED on his right hip, was standing in front of the metal box that looked like a subway entrance closed for the night. Eddie left the wheelchair at the edge of the clearing and walked over. As he did, the steady humming noise and the vibration under his feet became louder. The machinery making the noise, he realized, was either inside the box or under it. It seemed that he heard it not with his ears but somewhere deep inside his head, and in the hollows of his gut.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So this is one of the twelve portals. Where does it go, Roland? Disney World?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “I don’t know where it goes. Maybe nowhere . . . or everywhere. There’s a lot about my world I don’t know—surely you both have realized that. And there are things I used to know which have changed.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because the world has moved on?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” Roland glanced at him. “Here, that is not a figure of speech. The world really is moving on, and it goes ever faster. At the same time, things are wearing out . . . falling apart . . .” He kicked the mechanical corpse of the walking box to illustrate his point.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie thought of the rough diagram of the portals which Roland had drawn in the dirt. <i class="calibre3">“Is</i> this the edge of the world?” he asked, almost timidly. “I mean, it doesn’t look much different than anyplace else.” He laughed a little. “If there’s a drop-off, I don’t see it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “It’s not that kind of edge. It’s the place where one of the Beams starts. Or so I was taught.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Beams?” Susannah asked. “What Beams?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The Great Old Ones didn’t make the world, but they did <i class="calibre3">re</i>-make it. Some tale-tellers say the Beams saved it; others say they are the seeds of the world’s destruction. The Great Old Ones created the Beams. They are lines of some sort . . lines which <i class="calibre3">bind</i> . . . and <i class="calibre3">hold</i> . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you talking about magnetism?” Susannah asked cautiously.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His whole face lit up, transforming its harsh planes and furrows into something new and amazing, and for a moment Eddie knew how Roland would look if he actually <i class="calibre3">did</i> reach his Tower.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes! Not <i class="calibre3">just</i> magnetism, but that is a part of it . . . and gravity . . . and the proper alignment of space, size, and dimension. The Beams are the forces which bind these things together.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Welcome to physics in the nuthouse,” Eddie said in a low voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah ignored this. “And the Dark Tower? Is it some kind of generator? A central power-source for these Beams?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But you <i class="calibre3">do</i> know that this is point A,” Eddie said. “If we walked long enough in a straight line, we’d come to another portal—call it point C—on the other edge of the world. But before we did, we’d come to point B. The center-point. The Dark Tower.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How long a trip is it? Do you know?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. But I know it’s very far, and that the distance grows with every day that passes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie had bent to examine the walking box. Now he straightened up and stared at Roland. “That can’t be.” He sounded like a man trying to explain to a small child that there really isn’t a boogeyman living in his closet, that there <i class="calibre3">can’t</i> be because there isn’t any such thing as the boogeyman, not really. “Worlds don’t <i class="calibre3">grow,</i> Roland.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t they? When I was a boy, Eddie, there were maps. I remember one in particular. It was called The Greater Kingdoms of the Western Earth. It showed my land, which was called by the name Gilead. It showed the Downland Baronies, which were overrun by riot and civil war in the year after I won my guns, and the hills, and the desert, and the mountains, and the Western Sea. It was a long distance from Gilead to the Western Sea—a thousand miles or more—<i class="calibre3">but it had taken me over twenty years to cross that distance.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s impossible,” Susannah said quickly, fearfully. “Even if you <i class="calibre3">walked</i> the whole distance it couldn’t take twenty years.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, you have to allow for stops to write post-cards and drink beer,” Eddie said, but they both ignored him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I didn’t walk but rode most of the distance on horseback,” Roland said. “I was—slowed up, shall we say?—every now and then, but for most of that time I was moving. Moving away from John Farson, who led the revolt which toppled the world I grew up in and who wanted my head on a pole in his courtyard—he had good reason to want that, I suppose, since I and my compatriots were responsible for the deaths of a great many of his followers—and because I stole something he held very dear.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What, Roland?” Eddie asked curiously.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “That’s a story for another day . . . or maybe never. For now, think not of that but of this: I’ve come <i class="calibre3">many</i> thousands of miles. Because the world is growing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A thing like that just can’t happen,” Eddie reiterated, but he was badly shaken, all the same. “There’d be earthquakes . . . floods . . . tidal waves . . . I don’t know what all . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Look!”</i> Roland said furiously. “Just look around you! What do you see? A world that is slowing down like a child’s top even as it speeds up and moves on in some other way none of us understand. Look at your kills, Eddie! Look at your kills, for your father’s sake!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He took two strides toward the stream, picked up the steel snake, examined it briefly, and tossed it to Eddie, who caught it with his left hand. The snake broke in two pieces as he did so.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You see? It’s exhausted. <i class="calibre3">All</i> the creatures we found here were exhausted. If we hadn’t come, they would have died before long, anyway. Just as the bear would have died.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The bear had some sort of disease,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger nodded. “Parasites which attacked the natural parts of its body. But why did they never attack it before?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah did not reply.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was examining the snake. Unlike the bear, it appeared to be a totally artificial construction, a thing of metal, circuits, and yards (or maybe miles) of gossamer-thin wire. Yet he could see flecks of rust, not just on the surface of the half-snake he still held, but in its guts as well. And there was a patch of wetness where either oil had leaked out or water had seeped in. This moisture had rotted away some of the wires, and a greenish stuff that looked like moss had grown over several of the thumbnail-sized circuit boards.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie turned the snake over. A steel plate proclaimed it to be the work of North Central Positronics, Ltd. There was a serial number, but no name. <i class="calibre3">Probably too unimportant to name, he thought. Just a sophisticated mechanical Roto-Rooter designed to give old Br’er Bear an enema every once in a while, keep him regular, or something equally disgusting.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He dropped the snake and wiped his hands on his pants.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland had picked up the tractor-gadget. He yanked at one of the treads. It came off easily, showering a cloud of rust down between his boots. He tossed it aside.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Everything in the world is either coming to rest or falling to pieces,” he said flatly. “At the same time, the forces which interlock and give the world its coherence—in time and size as well as in space—are weakening. We knew that even as children, but we had no idea what the time of the end would be like. How could we? Yet now I am living in those times, and I don’t believe they affect my world alone. They affect yours, Eddie and Susannah; they may affect a billion others. The Beams are breaking down. I don’t know if that’s a cause or only another symptom, but I know it’s true. Come! Draw close! Listen!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As Eddie approached the metal box with its alternating diagonal slashes of yellow and black, a strong and unpleasant memory seized him—for the first time in years he found himself thinking of a crumbling Victorian wreck in Dutch Hill, about a mile away from the neighborhood he and Henry had grown up in. This wreck, which was known as The Mansion to the neighborhood kids, occupied a plot of weedy, untended lawn on Rhinehold Street. Eddie guessed that practically all the kids in the borough had heard spooky stories about The Mansion. The house stood slumped beneath its steep roofs, seeming to glare at passersby from the deep shadows thrown by its eaves. The windows were gone, of course—kids can throw rocks through windows without getting too close to a place—but it had not beenspray-painted, and it had not become a make-out spot or a shooting gallery. Oddest of all was the simple fact of its continued existence: no one had set it on fire to collect the insurance or just to see it burn. The kids said it was haunted, of course, and as Eddie stood on the sidewalk with Henry one day, looking at it (they had made the pilgrimage specifically to see this object of fabulous rumor, although Henry had told their mother they were only going for Hoodsie Rockets at Dahlberg’s with some of his friends), it had seemed that it really <i class="calibre3">might</i> be haunted. Hadn’t he felt some strong and unfriendly force seeping from that old Victorian’s shadowy windows, windows that seemed to look at him with the fixed stare of a dangerous lunatic? Hadn’t he felt some subtle wind stirring the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck? Hadn’t he had the clear intuition that if he stepped inside that place, the door would slam and lock behind him and the walls would begin to close in, grinding the bones of dead mice to powder, wanting to crush <i class="calibre3">his</i> bones the same way?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Haunting. Haunted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He felt that same old sense of mystery and danger now, as he approached the metal box. Gooseflesh began to ripple up his legs and down his arms; the hair on the back of his neck bushed out and became rough, overlapping hackles. He felt that same subtle wind blowing past him, although the leaves on the trees which ringed the clearing were perfectly still.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yet he walked toward the door anyway (for that was what it was, of course, another door, although this one was locked and always would be against the likes of him), not stopping until his ear was pressed against it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was as if he had dropped a tab of really strong acid half an hour ago and it was just beginning to come on heavy. Strange colors flowed across the darkness behind his eyeballs. He seemed to hear voices murmuring up to him from long hallways like stone throats, halls which were lit with guttering electric torches. Once these flambeaux of the modern age had thrown a bright glare across everything, but now they were only sullen cores of blue light. He sensed emptiness . . . desertion . . . desolation . . . death.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The machinery rumbled on and on, but wasn’t there a rough undertone to the sound? A kind of desperate thudding beneath the hum, like the arrhythmia of a diseased heart? A feeling that the machinery producing this sound, although far more sophisticated even than that within the bear had been, was somehow falling out of tune with itself?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All is silent in the halls of the dead,” Eddie heard himself whisper in a falling, fainting voice. “All is forgotten in the stone halls of the dead. Behold the stairways which stand in darkness; behold the rooms of ruin. These are the halls of the dead where the spiders spin and the great circuits fall quiet, one by one.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland pulled him roughly back, and Eddie looked at him with dazed eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s enough,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Whatever they put in there isn’t doing so well, is it?” Eddie heard himself ask. His trembling voice seemed to come from far away. He could still feel the power coming out of that box. It called to him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. Nothing in my world is doing so well these days.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you boys are planning to camp here for the night, you’ll have to do without the pleasure of my company,” Susannah said. Her face was a white blur in the ashy aftermath of twilight. “I’m going over yonder. I don’t like the way that thing makes me feel.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’ll <i class="calibre3">all</i> camp over yonder,” Roland said. “Let’s go.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What a good idea,” Eddie said. As they moved away from the box, the sound of the machinery began to dim. Eddie felt its hold on him weakening, although it still called to him, invited him to explore the half-lit hallways, the standing stairways, the rooms of ruin where the spiders spun and the control panels were going dark, one by one.
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_28"><b class="calibre4">29</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    IN HIS DREAM THAT night, Eddie again went walking down Second Avenue toward Tom and Gerry’s Artistic Deli on the corner of Second and Forty-sixth. He passed a record store and the Rolling Stones boomed from the speakers:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">“I see a red door and I want to paint it black,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">No colours anymore, I want them to turn black,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer</i> <i class="calibre3">clothes,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I have to turn my head until my darkness goes . . .”</i>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He walked on, passing a store called Reflections of You between Forty-ninth and Forty-eighth. He saw himself in one of the mirrors hanging in the display window. He thought he looked better than he had in years—hair a little too long, but otherwise tanned and fit. The clothes, though . . . uh-uh, man. Square-bear shit all the way. Blue blazer, white shirt, dark red tie, gray dress pants . . . he had never owned a yuppie-from-hell outfit like that in his life.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Someone was shaking him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie tried to burrow deeper into the dream. He didn’t want to wake up now. Not before he got to the deli and used his key to go through the door and into the field of roses. He wanted to see it all again—the endless blanket of red, the overarching blue sky where those great white cloud-ships sailed, and the Dark Tower. He was afraid of the darkness which lived within that eldritch column, waiting to eat anyone who got too close, but he wanted to see it again just the same. <i class="calibre3">Needed</i> to see it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The hand, however, would not stop shaking. The dream began to darken, and the smells of car exhaust along Second Avenue became the smell of wood-smoke—thin now, because the fire was almost out.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was Susannah. She looked scared. Eddie sat up and put an arm around her. They had camped on the far side of the alder grove, within earshot of the stream babbling through the bone-littered clearing. On the other side of the glowing embers which had been their campfire, Roland lay asleep. His sleep was not easy. He had cast aside his single blanket and lay with his knees drawn up almost to his chest. With his boots off, his feet looked white and narrow and defenseless. The great toe of the right foot was gone, victim of the lobster-thing which had also snatched away part of his right hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was moaning some slurred phrase over and over again. After a few repetitions, Eddie realized it was the phrase he had spoken before keeling over in the clearing where Susannah had shot the bear: <i class="calibre3">Go, then—there are other worlds than these.</i> He would fall silent for a moment, then call out the boy’s name: “Jake! Where are you? <i class="calibre3">Jake!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The desolation and despair in his voice filled Eddie with horror. His arms stole around Susannah and he pulled her tight against him. He could feel her shivering, although the night was warm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger rolled over. Starlight fell into his open eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Jake, where are you?”</i> he called to the night. <i class="calibre3">“Come back!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh Jesus—he’s off again. What should we do, Suze?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. I just knew I couldn’t listen to it anymore by myself. He sounds so far away. So far away from everything.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go, then,” the gunslinger murmured, rolling back. onto his side and drawing his knees up once more, “there are other worlds than these.” He was silent for a moment. Then his chest hitched and he loosed the boy’s name in a long, bloodcurdling cry. In the woods behind them, some large bird flew away in a dry whirr of wings toward some less exciting part of the world.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you have any ideas?” Susannah asked. Her eyes were wide and wet with tears. “Maybe we should wake him up?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know.” Eddie saw the gunslinger’s revolver, the one he wore on his left hip. It had been placed, in its holster, on a neatly folded square of hide within easy reach of the place where Roland lay. “I don’t think I dare,” he added at last.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s driving him crazy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What do we do about it? Eddie, <i class="calibre3">what do we do?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie didn’t know. An antibiotic had stopped the infection caused by the bite of the lobster-thing; now Roland was burning with infection again, but Eddie didn’t think there was an antibiotic in the world that would cure what was wrong with him this time.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. Lie down with me, Suze.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie threw a hide over both of them, and after a while her trembling quieted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If he goes insane, he may hurt us,” she said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t I know it.” This unpleasant idea had occurred to him in terms of the bear—its red, hate-filled eyes (and had there not been bewilderment as well, lurking deep in those red depths?) and its deadly slashing claws. Eddie’s eyes moved to the revolver, lying so close to the gunslinger’s good left hand, and he remembered again how fast Roland had been when he’d seen the mechanical bat swooping down toward them. So fast his hand had seemed to disappear. If the gunslinger went mad, and if he and Susannah became the focus of that madness, they would have no chance. No chance at all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pressed his face into the warm hollow of Susannah’s neck and closed his eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Not long after, Roland ceased his babbling. Eddie raised his head and looked over. The gunslinger appeared to be sleeping naturally again. Eddie looked at Susannah and saw that she had also gone to sleep. He lay down beside her, gently kissed the swell of her breast, and closed his own eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Not you, buddy; you’re gonna be awake a long, long time.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But they had been on the move for two days and Eddie was bone-tired. He drifted off . . . drifted down.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Back to the dream, he thought as he went. I want to go back to Second Avenue . . . back to Tom and Gerry’s. That’s what I want.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The dream did not return that night, however.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h30"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_29"><b class="calibre4">30</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THEY ATE A QUICK breakfast as the sun came up, repacked and redistributed the gear, and then returned to the wedge-shaped clearing. It didn’t look quite so spooky in the clear light of morning, but all three of them were still at pains to keep well away from the metal box with its warning slashes of black and yellow. If Roland had any recollection of the bad dreams which had haunted him in the night, he gave no sign. He had gone about the morning chores as he always did, in thoughtful, stolid silence.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How do you plan to keep to a straight-line course from here?” Susannah asked the gunslinger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If the legends are right, that should be no problem. Do you remember when you asked about magnetism?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He rummaged deep into his purse and at last emerged with a small square of old, supple leather. Threaded through it was a long silver needle.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A compass!” Eddie said. “You really <i class="calibre3">are</i> an Eagle Scout!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shook his head. “Not a compass. I know what they are, of course, but these days I keep my directions by the sun and stars, and even now they serve me quite well.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Even now?”</i> Susannah asked, a trifle uneasily. He nodded. “The directions of the world are also in drift.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Christ,”</i> Eddie said. He tried to imagine a world where true north was slipping slyly off to the east or west and gave up almost at once. It made him feel a little ill, the way looking down from the top of a high building had always made him feel a little ill.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This is just a needle, but it <i class="calibre3">is</i> steel and it should serve our purpose as well as a compass. The Beam is our course now, and the needle will show it.” He rummaged in his purse again and came out with a poorly made pottery cup. A crack ran down one side. Roland had mended this artifact, which he had found at the old campsite, with pine-gum. Now he went to the stream, dipped the cup into it, and brought it back to where Susannah sat in her wheelchair. He put the cup down carefully on the wheelchair’s arm, and when the surface of the water inside was calm, he dropped the needle in. It sank to the bottom and rested there.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wow!” Eddie said. “Great! I’d fall at your feet in wonder, Roland, but I don’t want to spoil the crease in my pants.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m not finished. Hold the cup steady, Susannah.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She did, and Roland pushed her slowly across the clearing. When she was about twelve feet in front of the door, he turned the chair carefully so she was facing away from it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie!” she cried. “Look at this!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He bent over the pottery cup, marginally aware that water was already oozing through Roland’s makeshift seal. The needle was rising slowly to the surface. It reached it and bobbed there as serenely as a cork would have done. Its direction lay in a straight line from the portal behind them and into the old, tangled forest ahead. “Holy shit—a floating needle. Now I really <i class="calibre3">have</i> seen everything.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hold the cup, Susannah.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She held it steady as Roland pushed the wheelchair further into the clearing, at right angles to the box. The needle lost its steady point, bobbed randomly for a moment, then sank to the bottom of the cup again. When Roland pulled the chair backward to its former spot, it rose once more and pointed the way.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If we had iron filings and a sheet of paper,” the gunslinger said, “we could scatter the filings on the paper’s surface and watch them draw together into a line which would point that same course.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Will that happen even when we leave the Portal?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “Nor is that all. We can actually <i class="calibre3">see</i> the Beam.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah looked over her shoulder. Her elbow bumped the cup a little as she did. The needle swung aimlessly as the water inside sloshed . . . and then settled firmly back in its original direction.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not that way,” Roland said. “Look down, both of you—Eddie at your feet, Susannah into your lap.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They did as he asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When I tell you to look up, look straight ahead, in the direction the needle points. Don’t look at any one thing; let your eye see whatever it will. Now—look up!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They did. For a moment Eddie saw nothing but the woods. He tried to make his eyes relax . . . and suddenly it was there, the way the shape of the slingshot had been there, inside the knob of wood, and he knew why Roland had told them not to look at any one thing. The effect of the Beam was everywhere along its course, but it was subtle. The needles of the pines and spruces pointed that way. The greenberry bushes grew slightly slanted, and the slant lay in the direction of the Beam. Not all the trees the bear had pushed down to clear its sightlines had fallen along that camouflaged path—which ran southeast, if Eddie had his directions right—but most had, as if the force coming out of the box had <i class="calibre3">pushed</i> them that way as they tottered. The clearest evidence was in the way the shadows lay on the ground. With the sun coming up in the east they all pointed west, of course, but as Eddie looked southeast, he saw a rough herringbone pattern that existed only along the line which the needle in the cup had pointed out.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I might see <i class="calibre3">something,”</i> Susannah said doubtfully, “but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look at the shadows! The <i class="calibre3">shadows,</i> Suze!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie saw her eyes widen as it all fell into place for her. “My God! It’s there! <i class="calibre3">Right there!</i> It’s like when someone has a natural part in their hair!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now that Eddie had seen it, he could not unsee it; a dim aisle driving through the untidy tangle which surrounded the clearing, a straight-edge course that was the way of the Beam. He was suddenly aware of how huge the force flowing around him (and probably right through him, like X-rays) must be, and had to control an urge to step away, either to the right or left. “Say, Roland, this won’t make me sterile, will it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shrugged, smiling faintly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s like a riverbed,” Susannah marvelled. “A riverbed so overgrown you can barely see it . . . but it’s still there. The pattern of shadows will never change as long as we stay inside the path of the Beam, will it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” Roland said. “They’ll change direction as the sun moves across the sky, of course, but we’ll always be able to see the course of the Beam. You must remember that it has been flowing along this same path for thousands—perhaps <i class="calibre3">tens</i> of thousands—of years. Look up, you two, into the sky!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They did, and saw that the thin cirrus clouds had also picked up that herringbone pattern along the course of the Beam . . . and those clouds within the alley of its power were flowing faster than those to either side. They were being pushed southeast. Being pushed in the direction of the Dark Tower.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You see? Even the clouds must obey.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A small flock of birds coursed toward them. As they reached the path of the Beam, they were all deflected toward the southeast for a moment. Although Eddie clearly saw this happen, his eyes could hardly credit it. When the birds had crossed the narrow corridor of the Beam’s influence, they resumed their former course.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well,” Eddie said, “I suppose we ought to get going. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and all that shit.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wait a minute.” Susannah was looking at Roland. “It <i class="calibre3">isn’t</i> just a thousand miles, is it? Not anymore. How far <i class="calibre3">are</i> we talking about, Roland? Five thousand miles? Ten?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I can’t say. It will be very far.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, how in the hell we ever goan get there, with you two pushing me in this goddam wheelchair? We’ll be lucky to make three miles a day through yonder Drawers, and you know it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The way has been opened,” Roland said patiently, “and that’s enough for now. The time may come, Susannah Dean, when we travel faster than you would like.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh yeah?” She looked at him truculently, and both men could see Detta Walker dancing a dangerous hornpipe in her eyes again. “You got a race-car lined up? If you do, it might be nice if we had a damn road to run it on!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The land and the way we travel on it will change. It always does.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah flapped a hand at the gunslinger; <i class="calibre3">go on with you,</i> it said. “You sound like my old mamma, sayin God will provide.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hasn’t He?” Roland asked gravely.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She looked at him for a moment in silent surprise, then threw her head back and laughed at the sky. “Well, I guess that depends on how you look at it. All I can say is that if this is providin, Roland, I’d hate to see what’d happen if He decided to let us go hungry.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on, let’s do it,” Eddie said. “I want to get out of this place. I don’t like it.” And that was true, but that wasn’t all. He also felt a deep eagerness to set his feet upon that concealed path, that highway in hiding. Every step was a step closer to the field of roses and the Tower which dominated it. He realized—not without some wonder—that he meant to see that Tower . . . or die trying.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Congratulations, Roland,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre3">You’ve done it. I’m one of the converted. Someone say hallelujah.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There’s one other thing before we go.” Roland bent and untied the rawhide lace around his left thigh. Then he slowly began to unbuckle his gunbelt.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s this jive?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland pulled the gunbelt free and held it out to him. “You know why I’m doing this,” he said calmly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Put it back on, man!” Eddie felt a terrible stew of conflicting emotions roiling inside him; could feel his fingers trembling even inside his clenched fists. “What do you think you’re <i class="calibre3">doing?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Losing my mind an inch at a time. Until the wound inside me closes—if it ever does—I am not fit to wear this. And you know it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take it, Eddie,” Susannah said quietly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you hadn’t been wearing this goddamn thing last night, when that bat came at me, I’d be gone from the nose up this morning!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger replied by continuing to hold his remaining gun out to Eddie. The posture of his body said he was prepared to stand that way all day, if that was what it took.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right!” Eddie cried. “Goddammit, all <i class="calibre3">right!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He snatched the gunbelt from Roland’s hand and buckled it about his own waist in a series of rough gestures. He should have been relieved, he supposed—hadn’t he looked at this gun, lying so close to Roland’s hand in the middle of the night, and thought about what might happen if Roland really <i class="calibre3">did</i> go over the high side? Hadn’t he and Susannah both thought about it? But there was no relief. Only fear and guilt and a strange, aching sadness far too deep for tears.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked so strange without his guns.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    So <i class="calibre3">wrong.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay? Now that the numb-fuck apprentices have the guns and the master’s unarmed, can we please go? If something big comes out of the bush at us, Roland, you can always throw your knife at it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, that,” he murmured. “I almost forgot.” He took the knife from his purse and held it out, hilt first, to Eddie.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This is <i class="calibre3">ridiculous!”</i> Eddie shouted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Life</i> is ridiculous.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah, put it on a postcard and send it to the fucking <i class="calibre3">Reader’s Digest.”</i> Eddie jammed the knife into his belt and then looked defiantly at Roland. “<i class="calibre3">Now</i> can we go?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There is one more thing,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Weeping, creeping <i class="calibre3">Jesus</i>!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The smile touched Roland’s mouth again. “Just joking,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie’s mouth dropped open. Beside him, Susannah began to laugh again. The sound rose, as musical as bells, in the morning stillness.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <div class="tx">
    IT TOOK THEM MOST of the morning to clear the zone of destruction with which the great bear had protected itself, but the going was a little easier along the path of the Beam, and once they had put the deadfalls and tangles of underbrush behind them, deep forest took over again and they were able to move at better speed. The brook which had emerged from the rock wall in the clearing ran busily along to their right. It had been joined by several smaller streamlets, and its sound was deeper now. There were more animals here—they heard them moving through the woods, going about their daily round—and twice they saw small groups of deer. One of them, a buck with a noble rack of antlers on its upraised and questioning head, looked to be at least three hundred pounds. The brook bent away from their path as they began to climb again. And, as the afternoon began to slant down toward evening, Eddie saw something.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Could we stop here? Rest a minute?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What is it?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said. “We can stop.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Suddenly Eddie felt Henry’s presence again, like a weight settling on his shoulders. <i class="calibre3">Oh lookit the sissy. Does the sissy see something in the twee? Does the sissy want to carve something? Does he? Ohhhh, ain’t that CUTE?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We don’t <i class="calibre3">have</i> to stop. I mean, no big deal. I just—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “—saw something,” Roland finished for him. “Whatever it is, stop running your everlasting mouth and get it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s really nothing.” Eddie felt warm blood mount into his face. He tried to look away from the ash tree which had caught his eye.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But it is. It’s something you need, and that’s a long way from nothing. If <i class="calibre3">you</i> need it, Eddie, <i class="calibre3">we</i> need it. What we don’t need is a man who can’t let go of the useless baggage of his memories.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The warm blood turned hot. Eddie stood with his flaming face pointed at his moccasins for a moment longer, feeling as if Roland had looked directly into his confused heart with his faded blue bombardier’s eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie?” Susannah asked curiously. “What is it, dear?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Her voice gave him the courage he needed. He walked to the slim, straight ash, pulling Roland’s knife from his belt.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Maybe nothing,” he muttered, and then forced himself to add: “Maybe a lot. If I don’t fuck it up, maybe quite a lot.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The ash is a noble tree, and full of power,” Roland remarked from behind him, but Eddie barely heard. Henry’s sneering, hectoring voice was gone; his shame was gone with it. He thought only of the one branch that had caught his eye. It thickened and bulged slightly as it ran into the trunk. It was this oddly shaped thickness that Eddie wanted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought the shape of the key was buried within it—the key he had seen briefly in the fire before the burning remains of the jawbone had changed again and the rose had appeared. Three inverted V’s, the center V both deeper and wider than the other two. And the little s-shape at the end. That was the secret.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A breath of his dream recurred: <i class="calibre3">Dad-a-chum, dud-a-chee, not to worry, you’ve got the key.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Maybe, he thought. But this time I’ll have to get all of it. I think that this time ninety per cent just won’t do</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Working with great care, he cut the branch from the tree and then trimmed the narrow end. He was left with a fat chunk of ash about nine inches long. It felt heavy and vital in his hand, very much alive and willing enough to give up its secret shape . . . to a man skillful enough to tease it out, that was.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Was he that man? And did it matter?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie Dean thought the answer to both questions was yes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger’s good left hand closed over Eddie’s right hand. “I think you know a secret.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Maybe I do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Can you tell?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He shook his head. “Better not to, I think. Not yet.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland thought this over, then nodded. “All right. I want to ask you one question, and then we’ll drop the subject. Have you perhaps seen some way into the heart of my . . . my problem?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie thought: <i class="calibre3">And that’s as close as he’ll ever come to showing the desperation that’s eating him alive.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. Right now I can’t tell for sure. But I hope so, man. I really, really do.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded again and released Eddie’s hand. “I thank you. We still have two hours of good daylight—why don’t we make use of them?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fine by me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They moved on. Roland pushed Susannah and Eddie walked ahead of them, holding the chunk of wood with the key buried in it. It seemed to throb with its own warmth, secret and powerful.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h32"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_31"><b class="calibre4">32</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THAT NIGHT, AFTER SUPPER was eaten, Eddie took the gunslinger’s knife from his belt and began to carve. The knife was amazingly sharp, and seemed never to lose its edge. Eddie worked slowly and carefully in the firelight, turning the chunk of ash this way and that in his hands, watching the curls of fine-grained wood rise ahead of his long, sure strokes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah lay down, laced her hands behind her head, and looked up at the stars wheeling slowly across the black sky.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At the edge of the campsite, Roland stood beyond the glow of the fire and listened as the voices of madness rose once more in his aching, confused mind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">There was a boy.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">There was no boy.</i>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Was.</i>

  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Was—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He closed his eyes, cupped his aching forehead in one cold hand, and wondered how long it would be until he simply snapped like an overwound bowstring.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Oh Jake,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre3">Where are you? Where are you?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And above the three of them, Old Star and Old Mother rose into their appointed places and stared at each other across the starry ruins of their ancient broken marriage.
