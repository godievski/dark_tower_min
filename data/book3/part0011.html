    FOR THREE WEEKS JOHN “Jake” Chambers fought bravely against the madness rising inside him. During that time he felt like the last man aboard a foundering ocean liner, working the bilge-pumps for dear life, trying to keep the ship afloat until the storm ended, the skies cleared, and help could arrive . . . help from somewhere. Help from <i class="calibre3">anywhere.</i> On May 31st, 1977, four days before school ended for the summer, he finally faced up to the fact that no help was going to come. It was time to give up; time to let the storm carry him away. The straw that broke the camel’s back was his Final Essay in English Comp.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    John Chambers, who was Jake to the three or four boys who were almost his friends (if his father had known this little factoid, he undoubtedly would have hit the roof), was finishing his first year at The Piper School. Although he was eleven and in the sixth grade, he was small for his age, and people meeting him for the first time often thought he was much younger. In fact, he had sometimes been mistaken for a girl until a year or so ago, when he had made such a fuss about having his hair cut short that his mother had finally relented and allowed it. With his father, of course, there had been no problem about the haircut. His father had just grinned his hard, stainless steel grin and said, <i class="calibre3">The kid wants to look like a Marine, Laurie. Good for him.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    To his father, he was never Jake and rarely John. To his father, he was usually just “the kid.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Piper School, his father had explained to him the summer before (the Bicentennial Summer, that had been—all bunting and flags and New York Harbor filled with Tall Ships), was, quite simply, The Best Damned School In The Country For A Boy Your Age. The fact that Jake had been accepted there had nothing to do with money, Elmer Chambers explained . . . almost <i class="calibre3">insisted.</i> He had been savagely proud of this fact, although, even at ten, Jake had suspected it might not be a <i class="calibre3">true</i> fact, that it might really be a bunch of bullshit his father had turned <i class="calibre3">into</i> a fact so he could casually drop it into the conversation at lunch or over cocktails: <i class="calibre3">My kid? Oh, he’s going to Piper. Best Damned School In The Country For A Boy His Age. Money won’t buy you into that school, you know; for Piper, it’s brains or nothing.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake was perfectly aware that in the fierce furnace of Elmer Chambers’s mind, the gross carbon of wish and opinion was often blasted into the hard diamonds which he called facts . . . or, in more informal circumstances, “factoids.” His favorite phrase, spoken often and with reverence, was <i class="calibre3">The fact is</i>, and he used it every chance he got.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The fact is, money doesn’t get anyone into The Piper School</i>, his father had told him during that Bicentennial Summer, the summer of blue skies and bunting and Tall Ships, a summer which seemed golden in Jake’s memory because he had not yet begun to lose his mind and all he had to worry about was whether or not he could cut the mustard at The Piper School, which sounded like a nest for newly hatched geniuses. The only thing that gets you into <i class="calibre3">a</i> place like Piper is what <i class="calibre3">you’ve got</i> up here. Elmer Chambers had reached over his desk and tapped the center of his son’s forehead with a hard, nicotine-stained finger. Get me, <i class="calibre3">kid?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake had nodded. It wasn’t necessary to talk to his father, because is father treated everyone—including his wife—the way he treated his underlings at the TV network where he was in charge of programming and an acknowledged master of The Kill. All you had to do was listen, nod in the right places, and after a while he let you go.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Good,</i> his father said, lighting one of the eighty Camel cigarettes he smoked each and every day. <i class="calibre3">We understand each other, then. You’re going to have to work your buttsky off, but you can cut it. They never would have sent us this if you couldn’t.</i> He picked up the letter of acceptance from The Piper School and rattled it. There was a kind of savage triumph in the gesture, as if the letter was an animal he had killed in the jungle, an animal he would now skin and eat. <i class="calibre3">So work hard. Make your grades. Make your mother and me proud of you. If you end the year with an A average in your courses, there’s a trip to Disney World in it for you. That’s something to shoot for, right, kiddo?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake had made his grades—A’s in everything (until the last three weeks, that was). He had, presumably, made his mother and father proud of him, although they were around so little that it was hard to tell. Usually there was <i class="calibre3">nobody</i> around when he came home from school except for Greta Shaw—the housekeeper—and so he ended up showing his A papers to her. After that, they migrated to a dark corner of his room. Sometimes Jake looked through them and wondered if they meant anything. He <i class="calibre3">wanted</i> them to, but he had serious doubts.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake didn’t think he would be going to Disney World this summer, A average or no A average.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought the nuthouse was a much better possibility.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As he walked in through the double doors of The Piper School at 8:45 on the morning of May 31st, a terrible vision came to him. He saw his father in his office at 70 Rockefeller Plaza, leaning over his desk with a Camel jutting from the corner of his mouth, talking to one of his underlings as blue smoke wreathed his head. All of New York was spread out behind and below his father, its thump and hustle silenced by two layers of Thermopane glass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The fact is, money doesn’t get anyone into Sunnyvale Sanitarium,</i> his father was telling the underling in a tone of grim satisfaction. He reached out and tapped the underling’s forehead. <i class="calibre3">The only thing that gets you into a place like that is when something big-time goes wrong up here in the attic. That’s what happened to the kid. But he’s working his goddam buttsky off. Makes the best fucking baskets in the place, they tell me. And when they let him out—if they ever do—there</i>’<i class="calibre3">s a trip in it for him. A trip to—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “—the way station,” Jake muttered, then touched his forehead with a hand that wanted to tremble. The voices were coming back. The yelling, conflicting voices which were driving him mad.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You’re dead, Jake. You were run over by a car and you’re dead.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Don’t be stupid! Look—see that poster? REMEMBER THE CLASS ONE PICNIC, it says. Do you think they have Class Picnics in the afterlife?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I don’t know. But I know you were run over by a car.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Yes. It happened on May 9th, at 8:25 A.M. You died less than a minute later.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No! No! No!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “John?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked around, badly startled. Mr. Bissette, his French teacher, was standing there, looking a little concerned. Behind him, the rest of the student body was streaming into the Common Room for the morning assembly. There was very little skylarking, and no yelling at all. Presumably these other students, like Jake himself, had been told by their parents how lucky they were to be attending Piper, where money didn’t matter (although tuition was $22,000 a year), only your brains. Presumably many of them had been promised trips this summer if their grades were good enough. Presumably the parents of the lucky trip-winners would even go along in some cases. Presumably—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “John, are you okay?” Mr. Bissette asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sure,” Jake said. “Fine. I overslept a little this morning. Not awake yet, I guess.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Bissette’s face relaxed and he smiled. “Happens to the best of us.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Not to my dad. The master of The Kill never oversleeps.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you ready for your French final?” Mr. Bissette asked. <i class="calibre3">“Voulez-vous faire l’examen cet après-midi?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think so,” Jake said. In truth he didn’t know if he was ready for the exam or not. He couldn’t even remember if he had <i class="calibre3">studied</i> for the French final or not. These days nothing seemed to matter much except for the voices in his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I want to tell you again how much I enjoyed having you this year, John. I wanted to tell your folks, too, but they missed Parents’ Night—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “They’re pretty busy,” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Bissette nodded. “Well, I have enjoyed you. I just wanted to say so . . . and that I’m looking forward to having you back for French II next year.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thanks,” Jake said, and wondered what Mr. Bissette would say if he added, <i class="calibre3">But I don’t think I’ll be taking French II next year, unless I can get a correspondence course delivered to my postal box at good old Sunnyvale.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Joanne Franks, the school secretary, appeared in the doorway of the Common Room with her small silver-plated bell in her hand. At The Piper School, <i class="calibre3">all</i> bells were rung by hand. Jake supposed that if you were a parent, that was one of its charms. Memories of the Little Red Schoolhouse and all that. He hated it himself. The sound of that bell seemed to go right through his head—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I can’t hold on much longer, he thought despairingly. I’m sorry, but I’m losing it. I’m really, really losing it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Bissette had caught sight of Ms. Franks. He turned away, then turned back again. <i class="calibre3">“Is</i> everything all right, John? You’ve seemed preoccupied these last few weeks. Troubled. Is something on your mind?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake was almost undone by the kindness in Mr. Bissette’s voice, but then he imagined how Mr. Bissette would look if he said: <i class="calibre3">Yes. Something is on my mind. One hell of a nasty little factoid. I died, you see, and I went into another world. And then I died again. You’re going to say that stuff like that doesn’t happen, and of course you’re right, and part of my mind knows you’re right, but most of my mind knows that you’re wrong. It did happen. I did die.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    If he said something like that, Mr. Bissette would be on the phone to Elmer Chambers at once, and Jake thought that Sunnyvale Sanitarium would probably look like a rest-cure after all the stuff his father would have to say on the subject of kids who started having crazy notions just before Finals Week. Kids who did things that couldn’t be discussed over lunch or cocktails. Kids Who Let Down The Side.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake forced himself to smile at Mr. Bissette. “I’m a little worried about exams, that’s all.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Bissette winked. “You’ll do fine.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ms. Franks began to ring the Assembly Bell. Each peal stabbed into Jake’s ears and then seemed to flash across his brain like a small rocket.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on,” Mr. Bissette said. “We’ll be late. Can’t be late on the first day of Finals Week, can we?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They went in past Ms. Franks and her clashing bell. Mr. Bissette headed toward the row of seats called Faculty Choir. There were lots of cute names like that at Piper School; the auditorium was the Common Room, lunch-hour was Outs, seventh- and eighth-graders were Upper Boys and Girls, and, of course, the folding chairs over by the piano (which Ms. Franks would soon begin to pound as mercilessly as she rang her silver bell) was Faculty Choir. All part of the tradition, Jake supposed. If you were a parent who knew your kid had Outs in the Common Room at noon instead of just slopping up Tuna Surprise in the caff, you relaxed into the assurance that everything was A-OK in the education department.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He slipped into a seat at the rear of the room and let the morning’s announcements wash over him. The terror ran endlessly on in his mind, making him feel like a rat trapped on an exercise wheel. And when he tried to look ahead to some better, brighter time, he could see only darkness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The ship was his sanity, and it was sinking.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Harley, the headmaster, approached the podium and imparted a brief exordium about the importance of Finals Week, and how the grades they received would constitute another step upon The Great Road of Life. He told them that the school was depending on them, <i class="calibre3">he</i> was depending on them, and their parents were depending on them. He did not tell them that the entire free world was depending on them, but he strongly implied that this might be so. He finished by telling them that bells would be suspended during Finals Week (the first and only piece of good news Jake had received that morning).
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ms. Franks, who had assumed her seat at the piano, struck an invocatory chord. The student body, seventy boys and fifty girls, each turned out in a neat and sober way that bespoke their parents’ taste and financial stability, rose as one and began to sing the school song. Jake mouthed the words and thought about the place where he had awakened after dying. At first he had believed himself to be in hell . . . and when the man in the black hooded robe came along, he had been sure of it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then, of course, the other man had come along. A man Jake had almost come to love.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">But he let me fall. He killed me.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He could feel prickly sweat breaking out on the back of his neck and between his shoulderblades.
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx">
      <i class="calibre3">“So we hail the halls of Piper,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
      <i class="calibre3">Hold its banner high;</i><br class="calibre2"/>
      <i class="calibre3">Hail to thee, our alma mater,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
      <i class="calibre3">Piper, do or die!”</i>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">God, what a shitty song,</i> Jake thought, and it suddenly occurred to him that his father would love it.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h2"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_1"><b class="calibre4">2</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    PERIOD ONE WAS ENGLISH Comp, the only class where there was no final. Their assignment had been to write a Final Essay at home. This was to be a typed document between fifteen hundred and four thousand words long. The subject Ms. Avery had assigned was <i class="calibre3">My Understanding of Truth.</i> The Final Essay would count as twenty-five per cent of their final grade for the semester.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake came in and took his seat in the third row. There were only eleven pupils in all. Jake remembered Orientation Day last September, when Mr. Harley had told them that Piper had The Highest Teacher To Student Ratio Of Any Fine Private Middle School In The East. He had popped his fist repeatedly on the lectern at the front of the Common Room to emphasize this point. Jake hadn’t been terribly impressed, but he had passed the information along to his father. He thought his father <i class="calibre3">would</i> be impressed, and he had not been wrong.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He unzipped his bookbag and carefully removed the blue folder which contained his Final Essay. He laid it on his desk, meaning to give it a final look-over, when his eye was caught by the door at the left side of the room. It led, he knew, to the cloakroom, and it was closed today because it was seventy degrees in New York and no one had a coat which needed storage. Nothing back there except a lot of brass coathooks in a line on the wall and a long rubber mat on the floor for boots. A few boxes of school supplies—chalk, blue-books and such—were stored in the far corner.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No big deal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    All the same, Jake rose from his seat, leaving the folder unopened on the desk, and walked across to the door. He could hear his classmates murmuring quietly together, and the riffle of pages as they checked their own Final Essays for that crucial misplaced modifier or fuzzy phrase, but these sounds seemed far away.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was the door which held his attention.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    In the last ten days or so, as the voices in his head grew louder and louder, Jake had become more and more fascinated with doors—all kinds of doors. He must have opened the one between his bedroom and the upstairs hallway five hundred times in just the last week, and the one between his bedroom and the bathroom a thousand. Each time he did it, he felt a tight ball of hope and anticipation in his chest, as if the answer to all of his problems lay somewhere behind this door or that one and he would surely find it ... eventually. But each time it was only the hall, or the bathroom, or the front walk, or whatever.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Last Thursday he had come home from school, thrown himself on his bed, and had fallen asleep—sleep, it seemed, was the only refuge which remained to him. Except when he’d awakened forty-five minutes later, he had been standing in the bathroom doorway, peering dazedly in at nothing more exciting than the toilet and the basin. Luckily, no one had seen him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now, as he approached the cloakroom door, he felt that same dazzling burst of hope, a certainty that the door would not open on a shadowy closet containing only the persistent smells of winter—flannel, rubber, and wet wool—but on some other world where he could be <i class="calibre3">whole</i> again. Hot, dazzling light would fall across the classroom floor in a widening triangle, and he would see birds circling in a faded blue sky the color of
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">(his eyes)</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    old jeans. A desert wind would blow his hair back and dry the nervous sweat on his brow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He would step through this door and be healed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned the knob and opened the door. Inside was only darkness and a row of gleaming brass hooks. One long-forgotten mitten lay near the stacked piles of blue-books in the corner.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His heart sank, and suddenly Jake felt like simply creeping into that dark room with its bitter smells of winter and chalkdust. He could move the mitten and sit in the corner under the coathooks. He could sit on the rubber mat where you were supposed to put your boots in the wintertime. He could sit there, put his thumb in his mouth, pull his knees tight against his chest, close his eyes, and . . . and . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And just give up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This idea—the <i class="calibre3">relief</i> of this idea—was incredibly attractive. It would be an end to the terror and confusion and dislocation. That last was somehow the worst; that persistent feeling that his whole life had turned into a funhouse mirror-maze.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yet there was deep steel in Jake Chambers as surely as there was deep steel in Eddie and Susannah. Now it flashed out its dour blue lighthouse gleam in the darkness. There would be no giving up. Whatever was loose inside him might tear his sanity away from him in the end, but he would give it no quarter in the meantime. Be damned if he would.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Never!</i> he thought fiercely. <i class="calibre3">Never! Nev</i>—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When you’ve finished your inventory of the school-supplies in the cloakroom, John, perhaps you’d care to join us,” Ms. Avery said from behind him in her dry, cultured voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a small gust of giggles as Jake turned away from the cloakroom. Ms. Avery was standing behind her desk with her long fingers tented lightly on the blotter, looking at him out of her calm, intelligent face. She was wearing her blue suit today, and her hair was pulled back in its usual bun. Nathaniel Hawthorne looked over her shoulder, frowning at Jake from his place on the wall.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sorry,” Jake muttered, and closed the door. He was immediately seized by a strong impulse to open it again, to double-check, to see if <i class="calibre3">this</i> time that other world, with its hot sun and desert vistas, was there.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Instead he walked back to his seat. Petra Jesserling looked at him with merry, dancing eyes. “Take <i class="calibre3">me</i> in there with you next time,” she whispered. “Then you’ll have something to look at.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake smiled in a distracted way and slipped into his seat.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thank you, John,” Ms. Avery said in her endlessly calm voice. “Now, before you pass in your Final Essays—which I am sure will all be very fine, very neat, very <i class="calibre3">specific—I</i> should like to pass out the English Department’s Short List of recommended summer reading. I will have a word to say about several of these excellent books—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As she spoke she gave a small stack of mimeographed sheets to David Surrey. David began to hand them out, and Jake opened his folder to take a final look at what he had written on the topic <i class="calibre3">My Understanding of Truth.</i> He was genuinely interested in this, because he could no more remember writing his Final Essay, than he could remember studying for his French final.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at the title page with puzzlement and growing unease. MY UNDERSTANDING OF TRUTH, <i class="calibre3">By John Chambers,</i> was neatly typed and centered on the sheet, and that was all right, but he had for some reason pasted two photographs below it. One was of a door—he thought it might be the one at Number 10, Downing Street, in London—and the other was of an Amtrak train. They were color shots, undoubtedly culled from some magazine.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Why did I do that? And when did I do it?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned the page and stared down at the first page of his Final Essay, unable to believe or understand what he was seeing. Then, as understanding began to trickle through his shock, he felt an escalating sense of horror. It had finally happened; he had finally lost enough of his mind so that other people would be able to <i class="calibre3">tell.</i>

    “And it is so <i class="calibre3">very</i> important that you <i class="calibre3">all</i> read <i class="calibre3">The Lord of the Flies,”</i> Ms. Avery was saying in her clear but somehow pale voice. “And when you do, you must ask yourselves certain questions. A good novel is often like a series of riddles within riddles, and this is a <i class="calibre3">very</i> good novel—one of the best written in the second half of the twentieth century. So ask yourselves first what the symbolic significance of the conch shell might be. Second—”

  <div class="tx1">
    Far away. Far, far away. Jake turned to the second page of his Final Essay with a trembling hand, leaving a dark smear of sweat on the first page.

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    Jake looked, up slowly. His heart was beating so hard that he saw a bright light like the afterimage of a flashbulb dancing in front of his eyes, a light that pulsed in and out with each titanic thud of his heart.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He saw Ms. Avery handing his Final Essay to his mother and father. Mr. Bissette was standing beside Ms. Avery, looking grave. He heard Ms. Avery say in her clear, pale voice: <i class="calibre3">Your son is seriously ill. If you need proof, just look at this Final Essay.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">John hasn’t been himself for the last three weeks or so,</i> Mr. Bissette added. <i class="calibre3">He seems frightened some of the time and dazed all of the time . . . not quite there, if you see what I mean</i>. Je pense que John est fou . . . comprenez-vous?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ms. Avery again: <i class="calibre3">Do you perhaps keep certain mood-altering prescription drugs in the house where John might have access to them?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake didn’t know about mood-altering drugs, but he knew his father kept several grams of cocaine in the bottom drawer of his study desk. His father would undoubtedly think he had been into it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now let me say a word about <i class="calibre3">Catch-22,</i>” Ms. Avery said from the front of the room. “This is a very <i class="calibre3">challenging</i> book for sixth- and seventh-grade students, but you will nonetheless find it entirely enchanting, if you open your minds to its <i class="calibre3">special charm.</i> You may think of this novel, if you like, as a comedy of the surreal.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I don’t need to read something like that, Jake thought. I’m living something like that, and it’s no comedy.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned over to the last page of his Final Essay. There were no words on it. Instead he had pasted another picture to the paper. It was a photograph of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He had used a crayon to scribble it black. The dark, waxy lines looped and swooped in lunatic coils.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He could remember doing none of this.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Absolutely <i class="calibre3">none</i> of it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now he heard his father saying to Mr. Bissette: Fou. <i class="calibre3">Yes, he’s definitely fou. A kid who’d fuck up his chance at a school like Piper HAS to be fou, wouldn’t you say? Well. . . I can handle this. Handling things is my job. Sunnyvale’s the answer. He needs to spend some time in Sunnyvale, making baskets and getting his shit back together. Don’t you worry about our kid, folks; he can run . . . but he can’t hide.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Would</i> they actually send him away to the nuthatch if it started to seem that his elevator no longer went all the way to the top floor? Jake thought the answer to that was a big you bet. No way his father was going to put up with a loony around the house. The name of the place they put him in might not be Sunnyvale, but there would be bars on the windows and there would be young men in white coats and crepe-soled shoes prowling the halls. The young men would have big muscles and watchful eyes and access to hypodermic needles full of artificial sleep.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">They’ll tell everybody I went away,</i> Jake thought. The arguing voices in his head were temporarily stilled by a rising tide of panic. <i class="calibre3">They’ll say I’m spending the year with my aunt and uncle in Modesto . . . or in Sweden as an exchange student . . . or repairing satellites in outer space. My mother won’t like it . . . she’ll cry . . . but she’ll go along. She has her boyfriends, and besides, she always goes along with what he decides. She . . . they . . . me . . .</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He felt a shriek welling up his throat and pressed his lips tightly together to hold it in. He looked down again at the wild black scribbles snarled across the photograph of the Leaning Tower and thought: <i class="calibre3">I have to get out of here. I have to get out right now.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He raised his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, John, what is it?” Ms. Avery was looking at him with the expression of mild exasperation she reserved for students who interrupted her in mid-lecture.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’d like to step out for a moment, if I may,” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This was another example of Piper-speak. Piper students did not ever have to “take a leak” or “tap a kidney” or, God forbid, “drop a load.” The unspoken assumption was that Piper students were too perfect to create waste byproducts in their tastefully silent glides through life. Once in a while someone requested permission to “step out for a moment,” and that was all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ms. Avery sighed. “Must you, John?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, ma’am.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right. Return as soon as possible.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, Ms. Avery.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He closed the folder as he got up, took hold of it, then reluctantly let go again. No good. Ms. Avery would wonder why he was taking his Final Essay to the toilet with him. He should have removed the damning pages from the folder and stuffed them in his pocket before asking for permission to step out. Too late now.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake walked down the aisle toward the door, leaving his folder on the desk and his bookbag lying beneath it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hope everything comes out all right, Chambers,” David Surrey whispered, and snickered into his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Still your restless lips, David,” Ms. Avery said, clearly exasperated now, and the whole class laughed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake reached the door leading to the hall, and as he grasped the knob, that feeling of hope and surety rose in him again: <i class="calibre3">This is it—really it. I’ll open the door and the desert sun will shine in. I’ll feel that dry wind on my face. I’ll step through and never see this classroom again.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He opened the door and it was only the hallway on the other side, but he was right about one thing just the same: he never saw Ms. Avery’s classroom again.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h4"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_3"><b class="calibre4">4</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    HE WALKED SLOWLY DOWN the dim, wood-panelled corridor, sweating lightly. He walked past classroom doors he would have felt compelled to open if not for the clear glass windows set in each one. He looked into Mr. Bissette’s French II class and Mr. Knopf’s Introduction to Geometry class. In both rooms the pupils sat with pencils in hand and heads bowed over open blue-books. He looked into Mr. Harley’s Spoken Arts class and saw Stan Dorfman—one of those acquaintances who were not quite friends—beginning his Final Speech. Stan looked scared to death, but Jake could have told Stan he didn’t have the slightest idea what fear—<i class="calibre3">real</i> fear—was all about.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I died.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No. I didn’t.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Did too.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Did not.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Did.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Didn’t.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He came to a door marked GIRLS. He pushed it open, expecting to see a bright desert sky and a blue haze of mountains on the horizon. Instead he saw Belinda Stevens standing at one of the sinks, looking into the mirror above the basin and squeezing a pimple on her forehead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jesus Christ, do you mind?” she asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sorry. Wrong door. I thought it was the desert.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“What?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But he had already let the door go and it was swinging shut on its pneumatic elbow. He passed the drinking fountain and opened the door marked BOYS. <i class="calibre3">This</i> was it, he knew it, was sure of it, this was the door which would take him back—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Three urinals gleamed spotlessly under the fluorescent lights. A tap dripped solemnly into a sink. That was all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake let the door close. He walked on down the hall, his heels making firm little clicks on the tiles. He glanced into the office before passing it and saw only Ms. Franks. She was talking on the telephone, swinging back and forth in her swivel chair and playing with a lock of her hair. The silver-plated bell stood on the desk beside her. Jake waited until she swivelled away from the door and then hurried past. Thirty seconds later he was emerging into the bright sunshine of a morning in late May. .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I’ve gone truant,</i> he thought. Even his distraction did not keep him from being amazed at this unexpected development. <i class="calibre3">When I don’t come back from the bathroom in five minutes or so, Ms. Avery will send somebody to check . . . and then they’ll know. They’ll all know that I’ve left school, gone truant.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought of the folder lying on his desk.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">They’ll read it and they’ll think I’m crazy. Fou. Sure they will. Of course. Because I am.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then another voice spoke. It was, he thought, the voice of the man with the bombardier’s eyes, the man who wore the two big guns slung low on his hips. The voice was cold . . . but not without comfort.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">No, Jake,</i> Roland said. <i class="calibre3">You’re not crazy. You’re lost and scared, but you’re not crazy and need fear neither your shadow in the morning striding behind you nor your shadow at evening rising to meet you. You have to find your way back home, that’s all.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But where do I go?” Jake whispered. He stood on the sidewalk of Fifty-sixth Street between Park and Madison, watching the traffic bolt past. A city bus snored by, laying a thin trail of acrid blue diesel smoke. “Where do I go? Where’s the fucking <i class="calibre3">door?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But the voice of the gunslinger had fallen silent.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned left, in the direction of the East River, and began to walk blindly forward. He had no idea where he was going—no idea at all. He could only hope his feet would carry him to the right place ... as they had carried him to the wrong one not long ago.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_4"><b class="calibre4">5</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    IT HAD HAPPENED THREE weeks earlier.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One could not say <i class="calibre3">It all began three weeks earlier,</i> because that gave the impression that there had been some sort of progression, and that wasn’t right. There had been a progression to the <i class="calibre3">voices,</i> to the violence with which each insisted on its own particular version of reality, but the rest of it had happened all at once.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He left home at eight o’clock to walk to school—he always walked when the weather was good, and the weather this May had been absolutely fine. His father had left for the Network, his mother was still in bed, and Mrs. Greta Shaw was in the kitchen, drinking coffee and reading her <i class="calibre3">New York Post.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Goodbye, Greta,” he said. “I’m going to school now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She raised a hand to him without looking up from the paper. “Have a good day, Johnny.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    All according to routine. Just another day in the life.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And so it had been for the next fifteen hundred seconds. Then everything had changed forever.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He idled along, bookbag in one hand, lunch sack in the other, looking in the windows. Seven hundred and twenty seconds from the end of his life as he had always known it, he paused to look in the window of Brendio’s, where mannequins dressed in fur coats and Edwardian suits stood in stiff poses of conversation. He was thinking only of going bowling that afternoon after school. His average was 158, great for a kid who was only eleven. His ambition was to some day be a bowler on the pro tour (and if his father had known <i class="calibre3">this</i> little factoid, he <i class="calibre3">also</i> would have hit the roof).
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Closing in now—closing in on the moment when his sanity would be suddenly eclipsed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He crossed Thirty-ninth and there were four hundred seconds left. Had to wait for the WALK light at Forty-first and there were two hundred and seventy. Paused to look in the novelty shop on the corner of Fifth and Forty-second and there were a hundred and ninety. And now, with just over three minutes left in his ordinary life, Jake Chambers walked beneath the unseen umbrella of that force which Roland called <i class="calibre3">ka-tet.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    An odd, uneasy feeling began to creep over him. At first he thought it was a feeling of being watched, and then he realized it wasn’t that at all . . . or not <i class="calibre3">precisely</i> that. He felt that he had been here before; that he was reliving a dream he had mostly forgotten. He waited for the feeling to pass, but it didn’t. It grew stronger, and now began to mix with a sensation he reluctantly recognized as terror.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Up ahead, on the near corner of Fifth and Forty-third, a black man in a Panama hat was setting up a pretzel-and-soda cart.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">He’s the one that yells “Oh my God, he’s kilt!”</i> Jake thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Approaching the far corner was a fat lady with a Bloomingdale’s bag in her hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">She’ll drop the bag. Drop the bag and put her hands to her mouth and scream. The bag will split open. There’s a doll inside the bag. It’s wrapped in a red towel. I’ll see this from the street. From where I’ll be lying in the street with my blood soaking into my pants and spreading around me in a pool.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Behind the fat woman was a tall man in a gray nailhead worsted suit. He was carrying a briefcase.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">He’s the one who vomits on his shoes. He’s the one who drops his briefcase and throws up on his shoes. What’s happening to me?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Yet his feet carried him numbly forward toward the intersection, where people were crossing in a brisk, steady stream. Somewhere behind him, closing in, was a killer priest. He <i class="calibre3">knew</i> this, just as he knew that the priest’s hands would in a moment be outstretched to push . . . but he could not look around. It was like being locked in a nightmare where things simply had to take their course.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Fifty-three seconds left now. Ahead of him, the pretzel vendor was opening a hatch in the side of his cart.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">He’s going to take out a bottle of Yoo-Hoo, Jake thought. Not a can but a bottle. He’ll shake it up and drink it all at once.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The pretzel vendor brought out a bottle of Yoo-Hoo, shook it vigorously, and spun off the cap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Forty seconds left.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Now the light will change.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    White WALK went out. Red DONT WALK began to flash rapidly on and off. And somewhere, less than half a block away, a big blue Cadillac was now rolling toward the intersection of Fifth and Forty-third. Jake <i class="calibre3">knew</i> this, just as he knew the driver was a fat man wearing a hat almost the exact same blue shade as his car.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I’m going to die!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He wanted to scream this aloud to the people walking heedlessly all around him, but his jaws were locked shut. His feet swept him serenely onward toward the intersection. The DONT WALK sign stopped flashing and shone out its solid red warning. The pretzel vendor tossed his empty Yoo-Hoo bottle into the wire trash basket on the corner. The fat lady stood on the corner across the street from Jake, holding her shopping bag by the handles. The man in the nailhead suit was directly behind her. Now there were eighteen seconds left.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Time for the toy truck to go by,</i> Jake thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ahead of him a van with a picture of a happy jumping-jack and the words TOOKER’S WHOLESALE TOYS printed on the side swept through the intersection, jolting up and down in the potholes. Behind him, Jake knew, the man in the black robe was beginning to move faster, closing the gap, now reaching out with his long hands. Yet he could not look around, as you couldn’t look around in dreams when something awful was gaining on you.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Run! And if you can’t run, sit down and grab hold of a No Parking sign! Don’t just let it happen!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But he was powerless to stop it from happening. Ahead, on the edge of the curb, was a young woman in a white sweater and a black skirt. To her left was a young Chicano guy with a boombox. A Donna Summer disco tune was just ending. The next song, Jake knew, would be “Dr. Love,” by Kiss.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">They’re going to move apart—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Even as the thought came, the woman moved a step to her right. The Chicano guy moved a step to his left, creating a gap between them. Jake’s traitor feet swept him into the gap. Nine seconds now.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Down the street, bright May sunshine twinkled on a Cadillac hood ornament. It was, Jake knew, a 1976 Sedan de Ville. Six seconds. The Caddy was speeding up. The light was getting ready to change and the man driving the de Ville, the fat man in the blue hat with the feather stuck jauntily in the brim, meant to scat through the intersection before it could. Three seconds. Behind Jake, the man in black was lunging forward. On the young man’s boombox, “Love to Love You, Baby” ended and “Dr. Love” began.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Two.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Cadillac changed to the lane nearest Jake’s side of the street and charged down on the intersection, its killer grille snarling.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s breath stopped in his throat.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    None.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Uh!” Jake cried as the hands struck him firmly in the back, pushing him, pushing him into the street, pushing him out of his life—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Except there <i class="calibre3">were</i> no hands.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He reeled forward nevertheless, hands flailing at the air, his mouth a dark O of dismay. The Chicano guy with the boombox reached out, grabbed Jake’s arm, and hauled him backward. “Look out, little hero,” he said. “That traffic turn you into bratwurst.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Cadillac floated by. Jake caught a glimpse of the fat man in the blue hat peering out through the windshield, and then it was gone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That was when it happened; that was when he split down the middle and became two boys. One lay dying in the street. The other stood here on the corner, watching in dumb, stricken amazement as DONT WALK turned to WALK again and people began to cross around him just as if nothing had happened . . . as, indeed, nothing had.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I’m alive!</i> half of his mind rejoiced, screaming with relief.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Dead!</i> the other half screamed back. <i class="calibre3">Dead in the street! They’re all gathering around me, and the man in black who pushed me is saying “I am a priest. Let me through.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Waves of faintness rushed through him and turned his thoughts to billowing parachute silk. He saw the fat lady approaching, and as she passed, Jake looked into her bag. He saw the bright blue eyes of a doll peeping above the edge of a red towel, just as he had known he would. Then she was gone. The pretzel vendor was not yelling <i class="calibre3">Oh my God, he’s kilt;</i> he was continuing to set up for the day’s business while he whistled the Donna Summer tune that had been playing on the Chicano guy’s radio.

    Jake turned around, looking wildly for the priest who was not a priest. He wasn’t there.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake moaned.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Snap out of it! What’s wrong with you?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He didn’t know. He only knew he was supposed to be lying in the street right now, getting ready to die while the fat woman screamed and the guy in the nailhead worsted suit threw up and the man in black pushed through the gathering crowd.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">And in part of his mind, that did seem to be happening.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The faintness began to return. Jake suddenly dropped his lunch sack to the pavement and slapped himself across the face as hard as he could. A woman on her way to work gave him a queer look. Jake ignored her. He left his lunch lying on the sidewalk and plunged into the intersection, also ignoring the red DONT WALK light, which had begun to stutter on and off again. It didn’t matter now. Death had approached . . . and then passed by without a second glance. It hadn’t been meant to happen that way, and on the deepest level of his existence he knew that, but it had.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Maybe now he would live forever.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The thought made him feel like screaming all over again.

    HIS HEAD HAD CLEARED a little by the time he got to school, and his mind had gone to work trying to convince him that nothing was wrong, really nothing at all. Maybe something a little weird <i class="calibre3">had</i> happened, some sort of psychic flash, a momentary peek into one possible future, but so what? No big deal, right? The idea was actually sort of cool—the kind of thing they were always printing in the weird supermarket newspapers Greta Shaw liked to read when she was sure Jake’s mother wasn’t around—papers like the <i class="calibre3">National Enquirer</i> and <i class="calibre3">Inside View</i>. Except, of course, in those papers the psychic flash was always a kind of tactical nuclear strike—a woman who dreamed of a plane crash and changed her reservations, or a guy who dreamed his brother was being held prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory and it turned out to be true. When your psychic flash consisted of knowing that a Kiss song was going to play next on the radio, that a fat lady had a doll wrapped in a red towel in her Bloomingdale’s bag, and that a pretzel vendor was going to drink a bottle of Yoo-Hoo instead of a can, how big a deal could it be?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Forget it,</i> he advised himself. <i class="calibre3">It’s over.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A great idea, except by period three he knew it <i class="calibre3">wasn’t</i> over; it was just beginning. He sat in Pre-Algebra, watching Mr. Knopf solving simple equations on the board, and realized with dawning horror that a whole new set of memories was surfacing in his mind. It was like watching strange objects float slowly- toward the surface of a muddy lake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I’m in a place I don’t know, he thought. I mean, I will know it—or would have known it if the Cadillac had hit me. It’s the way station—but the part of me that’s there doesn’t know that yet. That part only knows it’s in the desert someplace, and there are no people. I’ve been crying, because I’m scared. I’m scared that this might be hell.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    By three o’clock, when he arrived at Mid-Town Lanes, he knew he had found the pump in the stables and had gotten a drink of water. The water was very cold and tasted strongly of minerals. Soon he would go inside and find a small supply of dried beef in a room which had once been a kitchen. He knew this as clearly and surely as he’d known the pretzel vendor would select a bottle of Yoo-Hoo, and that the doll peeking out of the Bloomingdale’s bag had blue eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was like being able to remember forward in time.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He bowled only two strings—the first a 96, the second an 87. Timmy looked at his sheet when he turned it in at the counter and shook his head. “You’re having an off-day today, champ,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You don’t know the half of it,” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Timmy took a closer look. “You okay? You look really pale.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think I might be coming down with a bug.” This didn’t feel like a lie, either. He was sure as hell coming down with <i class="calibre3">something.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Go home and go to bed,” Timmy advised. “Drink lots of clear liquids—gin, vodka, stuff like that.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake smiled dutifully. “Maybe I will.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He walked slowly home. All of New York was spread out around him, New York at its most seductive—a late-afternoon street serenade with a musician on every corner, all the trees in bloom, and everyone apparently in a good mood. Jake saw all this, but he also saw <i class="calibre3">behind</i> it: saw himself cowering in the shadows of the kitchen as the man in black drank like a grinning dog from the stable pump, saw himself sobbing with relief as he—or it—moved on without discovering him, saw himself falling deeply asleep as the sun went down and the stars began to come out like chips of ice in the harsh purple desert sky.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He let himself into the duplex apartment with his key and walked into the kitchen to get something to eat. He wasn’t hungry, but it was habit. He was headed for the refrigerator when his eye happened on the pantry door and he stopped. He realized suddenly that the way station—and all the rest of that strange other world where he now belonged—was behind that door. All he had to do was push through it and rejoin the Jake that already existed there. The queer doubling in his mind would end; the voices, endlessly arguing the question of whether or not he had been dead since 8:25 that morning, would fall silent.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake pushed open the pantry door with both hands, his face already breaking into a sunny, relieved smile . . . and then froze as Mrs. Shaw, who was standing on a step-stool at the back of the pantry, screamed. The can of tomato paste she had been holding dropped out of her hand and fell to the floor. She tottered on the stool and Jake rushed forward to steady her before she could join the tomato paste.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Moses in the bullrushes!” she gasped, fluttering a hand rapidly against the front of her housedress. “You scared the bejabbers out of me, Johnny!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m sorry,” he said. He really was, but he was also bitterly disappointed. It had only been the pantry, after all. He had been so <i class="calibre3">sure—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What are you doing, creeping around here, anyway? This is your bowling day! I didn’t expect you for at least another hour! I haven’t even made your snack yet, so don’t be expecting it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s okay. I’m not very hungry, anyway.” He bent down and picked up the can she had dropped.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Wouldn’t know it from the way you came bustin in here,” she grumbled.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I thought I heard a mouse or something. I guess it was just you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I guess it was.” She descended the step-stool and took the can from him. “You look like you’re comin down with the flu or something, Johnny.” She pressed her hand against his forehead. “You don’t feel hot, but that doesn’t always mean much.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think I’m just tired,” Jake said, and thought: <i class="calibre3">If only that was all it was.</i> “Maybe I’ll just have a soda and watch TV for a while.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She grunted. “You got any papers you want to show me? If you do, make it fast. I’m behind on supper.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nothing today,” he said. He left the pantry, got a soda, then went into the living room. He turned on <i class="calibre3">Hollywood Squares</i> and watched vacantly as the voices argued and the new memories of that dusty other world continued to surface.
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    His MOTHER AND FATHER didn’t notice anything was wrong with him—his father didn’t even get in until 9:30—and that was fine by Jake. He went to bed at ten and lay awake in the darkness, listening to the city outside his window: brakes, horns, wailing sirens.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You died.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I didn’t, though. I’m right here, safe in my own bed.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That doesn’t matter. You died, and you know it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The hell of it was, he knew both things.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I don’t know which voice is true, but I know I can’t go on like this. So just quit it, both of you. Stop arguing and leave me alone. Okay? Please?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But they wouldn’t. <i class="calibre3">Couldn’t,</i> apparently. And it came to Jake that he ought to get up—<i class="calibre3">right now</i>—and open the door to the bathroom. The other world would be there. The way station would be there and the rest of <i class="calibre3">him</i> would be there, too, huddled under an ancient blanket in the stable, trying to sleep and wondering what in hell had happened.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I can tell him,</i> Jake thought excitedly. He threw back the covers, suddenly knowing that the door beside his bookcase no longer led into the bathroom but to a world that smelled of heat and purple sage and fear in a handful of dust, a world that now lay under the shadowing wing of night. <i class="calibre3">I can tell him, but I won’t have to . . . because I’ll be IN him . . . I’ll BE him!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He raced across his darkened room, almost laughing with relief, and shoved open the door. And—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And it was his bathroom. Just his bathroom, with the framed Marvin Gaye poster on the wall and the shapes of the venetian blinds lying on the tiled floor in bars of light and shadow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stood there for a long time, trying to swallow his disappointment. It wouldn’t go. And it was bitter.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Bitter.

  <div class="tx">
    THE THREE WEEKS BETWEEN then and now stretched like a grim, blighted terrain in Jake’s memory—a nightmare wasteland where there had been no peace, no rest, no respite from pain. He had watched, like a helpless prisoner watching the sack of a city he had once ruled, as his mind buckled under the steadily increasing pressure of the phantom voices and memories. He had hoped the memories would stop when he reached the point in them where the man named Roland had allowed him to drop into the chasm under the mountains, but they didn’t. Instead they simply recycled and began to play themselves over again, like a tape set to repeat and repeat until it either breaks or someone comes along and shuts it off.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His perceptions of his more-or-less real life as a boy in New York City grew increasingly spotty as this terrible schism grew deeper. He could remember going to school, and to the movies on the weekend, and out to Sunday brunch with his parents a week ago (or had it been two?), but he remembered these things the way a man who has suffered malaria may remember the deepest, darkest phase of his illness: people became shadows, voices seemed to echo and overlap each other, and even such a simple act as eating a sandwich or obtaining a Coke from the machine in the gymnasium became a struggle. Jake had pushed through those days in a fugue of yelling voices and doubled memories. His obsession with doors—all kinds of doors—deepened; his hope that the gunslinger’s world might lie behind one of them never quite died. Nor was that so strange, since it was the only hope he had.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But as of today the game was over. He’d never had a chance of winning anyway, not really. He had given up. He had gone truant. Jake walked blindly east along the gridwork of streets, head down, with no idea of where he was going or what he would do when he got there.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <div class="tx">
    AFTER WALKING FOR A while, he began to come out of this unhappy daze and take some notice of his surroundings. He was standing on the corner of Lexington Avenue and Fifty-fourth Street with no memory at all of how he had come to be there. He noticed for the first time that it was an absolutely gorgeous morning. May 9th, the day this madness had started, had been pretty, but today was ten times better—that day, perhaps, when spring looks around herself and sees summer standing nearby, strong and handsome and with a cocky grin on his tanned face. The sun shone brightly off the glass walls of the midtown buildings; the shadow of each pedestrian was black and crisp. The sky overhead was a clear and blameless blue, dotted here and there with plump foul-weather clouds.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Down the street, two businessmen in expensive, well-cut suits were standing at a board wall which had been erected around a construction site. They were laughing and passing something back and forth. Jake walked in their direction, curious, and as he drew closer he saw that the two businessmen were playing tic-tac-toe on the wall, using an expensive Mark Cross pen to draw the grids and make the X’s and O’s. Jake thought this was a complete gas. As he approached, one of them made an O in the upper right-hand corner of the grid and then slashed a diagonal line through the middle.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Skunked again!” his friend said. Then this man, who looked like a high-powered executive or lawyer or big-time stockbroker, took the Mark Cross pen and drew another grid.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The first businessman, the winner, glanced to his left and saw Jake. He smiled. “Some day, huh, kid?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It sure is,” Jake said, delighted to find he meant every word.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Too nice for school, huh?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This time Jake actually laughed. Piper School, where you had Outs instead of lunch and where you sometimes stepped out but never had to take a crap, suddenly seemed far away and not at all important. “You know it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You want a game? Billy here couldn’t beat me at this when we were in the fifth grade, and he still can’t.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Leave the kid alone,” the second businessman said, holding out the Mark Cross pen. “This time you’re history.” He winked at Jake, and Jake amazed himself by winking back. He walked on, leaving the men to their game. The sense that something totally wonderful was going to happen—had perhaps already <i class="calibre3">begun</i> to happen—continued to grow, and his feet no longer seemed to be quite touching the pavement.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The WALK light on the corner came on, and he began to cross Lexington Avenue. He stopped in the middle of the street so suddenly that a messenger-boy on a ten-speed bike almost ran him down. It was a beautiful spring day—agreed. But that wasn’t why he felt so good, so suddenly aware of everything that was going on around him, so sure that some great thing was about to occur.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The voices had stopped.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They weren’t gone for good—he somehow knew this—but for the time being they had <i class="calibre3">stopped.</i> Why?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake suddenly thought of two men arguing in a room. They sit facing each other over a table, jawing at each other with increasing bitterness. After a while they begin to lean toward each other, thrusting their faces pugnaciously forward, bathing each other with a fine mist of outraged spittle. Soon they will come to blows. But before that can happen, they hear a steady thumping noise—the sound of a bass drum—and then a jaunty flourish of brass. The two men stop arguing and look at each other, puzzled.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What’s that?</i> one asks.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Dunno,</i> the other replies. <i class="calibre3">Sounds like a parade.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They rush to the window and it is a parade—a uniformed band marching in lock-step with the sun blazing off their horns, pretty majorettes twirling batons and strutting their long, tanned legs, convertibles decked with flowers and filled with waving celebrities.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The two men stare out the window, their quarrel forgotten. They will undoubtedly return to it, but for the time being they stand together like the best of friends, shoulder to shoulder, watching as the parade goes by—
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <div class="tx">
    A HORN BLARED, STARTLING Jake out of this story, which was as vivid as a powerful dream. He realized he was still standing in the middle of Lexington, and the light had changed. He looked around wildly, expecting to see the blue Cadillac bearing down on him, but the guy who had tooted his horn was sitting behind the wheel of a yellow Mustang convertible and grinning at him. It was as if everyone in New York had gotten a whiff of happy-gas today.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake waved at the guy and sprinted to the other side of the street. The guy in the Mustang twirled a finger around his ear to indicate that Jake was crazy, then waved back and drove on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    For a moment Jake simply stood on the far corner, face turned up to the May sunshine, smiling, digging the day. He supposed prisoners condemned to die in the electric chair must feel this way when they learn they have been granted a temporary reprieve.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The voices were still.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The question was, what was the parade which had temporarily diverted their attention? Was it just the uncommon beauty of this spring morning?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake didn’t think that was all. He didn’t think so because that sensation of <i class="calibre3">knowing</i> was creeping over him and through him again, the one which had taken possession of him three weeks ago, as he approached the corner of Fifth and Forty-sixth. But on May 9th, it had been a feeling of impending doom. Today it was a feeling of radiance, a sense of goodness and anticipation. It was as if . . . as if . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">White</i>. This was the word that came to him, and it clanged in his mind with clear and unquestionable rightness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s the White!” he exclaimed aloud. “The coming of the White!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He walked on down Fifty-fourth Street, and as he reached the corner of Second and Fifty-fourth, he once more passed under the umbrella of <i class="calibre3">ka-tet.</i>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_10"><b class="calibre4">11</b></h1>

  <div class="tx1">
    HE TURNED RIGHT, THEN stopped, turned, and retraced his steps to the corner. He needed to walk down Second Avenue now, yes, that was unquestionably correct, but this was the wrong side again. When the light changed, he hurried across the street and turned right again. That feeling, that sense of
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">(Whiteness)</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    rightness, grew steadily stronger. He felt half-mad with joy and relief. He was going to be okay. This time there was no mistake. He felt sure that he would soon begin to see people he recognized, as he had recognized the fat lady and the pretzel vendor, and they would be doing things he remembered in advance.

  <div class="tx1">
    Instead, he came to the bookstore.

    Jake went in, aware that he had, for the first time in three weeks, opened a door without hoping madly to find another world on the other side. A bell jingled overhead. The mild, spicy smell of old books hit him, and the smell was somehow like coming home.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The restaurant motif continued inside. Although the walls were lined with shelves of books, a fountain-style counter bisected the room. On Jake’s side of the counter were a number of small tables with wire-backed Malt Shoppe chairs. Each table had been arranged to display the day’s specials: Travis McGee novels by John D. MacDonald, Philip Marlowe novels by Raymond Chandler, Snopes novels by William Faulkner. A small sign on the Faulkner table said: <i class="calibre3">Some rare 1st eds available—pls ask</i>. Another sign, this one on the counter, read simply: BROWSE! A couple of customers were doing just that. They sat at the counter, drinking coffee and reading. Jake thought this was without a doubt the best bookstore he’d ever been in.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The question was, why was he here? Was it luck, or was it part of that soft, insistent feeling that he was following a trail—a kind of force-beam—that had been left for him to find?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He glanced at the display on a small table to his left and knew the answer.

    IT WAS A DISPLAY of children’s books. There wasn’t much room on the table, so there were only about a dozen of them<b class="calibre4">—</b><i class="calibre3">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, The Hobbit, Tom Sawyer</i>, things like that. Jake had been attracted by a story-book obviously meant for very young children. On the bright green cover was an anthropomorphic locomotive puffing its way up a hill. Its cowcatcher (which was bright pink) wore a happy grin and its headlight was a cheerful eye which seemed to invite Jake Chambers to come inside and read all about it. <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo,</i> the title proclaimed, Story and Pictures by Beryl Evans. Jake’s mind flashed back to his Final Essay, with the picture of the Amtrak train on the title-page and the words <i class="calibre3">choo-choo</i> written over and over again inside.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He grabbed the book and clutched it tightly, as if it might fly away if he relaxed his grip. And as he looked down at the cover, Jake found that he did not trust the smile on Charlie the Choo-Choo’s face. <i class="calibre3">You look happy, but I think that’s just the mask you wear, he thought. I don’t think you’re happy at all. And I don’t think Charlie’s your real name, either</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    These were crazy thoughts to be having, undoubtedly crazy, but they did not feel crazy. They felt sane. They felt <i class="calibre3">true</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Standing next to the place where <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> had been was a tattered paperback. The cover was quite badly torn and had been mended with Scotch tape now yellow with age. The picture showed a puzzled-looking boy and girl with a forest of question-marks over their heads. The title of this book was <i class="calibre3">Riddle-De-Dum! Brain-Twisters and Puzzles for Everyone!</i> No author was credited.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake tucked <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> under his arm and picked up the riddle book. He opened it at random and saw this:
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">When is a door not a door?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When it’s a jar,” Jake muttered. He could feel sweat popping out on his forehead . . . his arms . . . all over his body.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “When it’s a <i class="calibre3">jar!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Find something, son?” a mild voice inquired.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned around and saw a fat guy in an open-throated white shirt standing at the end of the counter. His hands were stuffed in the pockets of his old gabardine slacks. A pair of half-glasses were pushed up on the bright dome of his bald head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Jake said feverishly. “These two. Are they for sale?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Everything you see is for sale,” the fat guy said. “The building itself would be for sale, if I owned it. Alas, I only lease.” He held out his hand for the books and for a moment Jake balked. Then, reluctantly, he handed them over. Part of him expected the fat guy to flee with them, and if he did—if he gave the slightest indication of trying it—Jake meant to tackle him, rip the books out of his hands, and boogie. He <i class="calibre3">needed</i> those books.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay, let’s see what you got,” the fat man said. “By the way, I’m Tower. Calvin Tower.” He stuck out his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s eyes widened, and he took an involuntary step backward. “<i class="calibre3">What?</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The fat guy looked at him with some interest. “Calvin Tower. Which word is profanity in your language, O Hyperborean Wanderer?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Huh?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I just mean you look like someone goosed you, kid.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh. Sorry.” He clasped Mr. Tower’s large, soft hand, hoping the man wouldn’t pursue it. The name <i class="calibre3">had</i> given him a jump, but he didn’t know why. “I’m Jake Chambers.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Calvin Tower shook his hand. “Good handle, pard. Sounds like the footloose hero in a Western novel—the guy who blows into Black Fork, Arizona, cleans up the town, and then travels on. Something by Wayne D. Overholser, maybe. Except you don’t look footloose, Jake. You look like you decided the day was a little too nice to spend in school.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh . . . no. We finished up last Friday.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tower grinned. “Uh-huh. I bet. And you’ve gotta have these two items, huh? It’s sort of funny, what people have to have. Now you—I would have pegged you as a Robert Howard kind of kid from the jump, looking for a good deal on one of those nice old Donald M. Grant editions—the ones with the Roy Krenkel paintings. Dripping swords, mighty thews, and Conan the Barbarian hacking his way through the Stygian hordes. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That sounds pretty good, actually. These are for . . . uh, for my little brother. It’s his birthday next week.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Calvin Tower used his thumb to flip his glasses down onto his nose and had a closer look at Jake. “Really? You look like an only child to me. An only child if I ever saw one, enjoying a day of French leave as Mistress May trembles in her green gown just outside the bosky dell of June.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come again?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Never mind. Spring always puts me in a William Cowper-ish mood. People are weird but interesting, Tex—am I right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I guess so,” Jake said cautiously. He couldn’t decide if he liked this odd man or not.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One of the counter-browsers spun on his stool. He was holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a battered paperback copy of <i class="calibre3">The Plague</i> in the other. “Quit pulling the kid’s chain and sell him the books, Cal,” he said. “We’ve still got time to finish this game of chess before the end of the world, if you hurry up.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hurry is antithetical to my nature,” Cal said, but he opened <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> and peered at the price pencilled on the flyleaf. “A fairly common book, but this copy’s in unusually fine condition. Little kids usually rack the hell out of the ones they like. I should get twelve dollars for it—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Goddam thief,” the man who was reading <i class="calibre3">The Plague</i> said, and the other browser laughed. Calvin Tower paid no notice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “—but I can’t bear to dock you that much on a day like this. Seven bucks and it’s yours. Plus tax, of course. The riddle book you can have for free. Consider it my gift to a boy wise enough to saddle up and light out for the territories on the last real day of spring.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake dug out his wallet and opened it anxiously, afraid he had left the house with only three or four dollars. He was in luck, however. He had a five and three ones. He held the money out to Tower, who folded the bills casually into one pocket and made change out of the other.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t hurry off, Jake. Now that you’re here, come on over to the counter and have a cup of coffee. Your eyes will widen with amazement as I cut Aaron Deepneau’s spavined old Kiev Defense to ribbons.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t you wish,” said the man who was reading <i class="calibre3">The Plague</i>—Aaron Deepneau, presumably.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’d like to, but I can’t. I . . . there’s someplace I have to be. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay. As long as it’s not back to school.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake grinned. “No—not school. That way lies madness.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tower laughed out loud and flipped his glasses up to the top of his head again. “Not bad! Not bad at all! Maybe the younger generation isn’t going to hell after all, Aaron—what do you think?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, they’re going to hell, all right,” Aaron said. “This boy’s just an exception to the rule. Maybe.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t mind that cynical old fart,” Calvin Tower said. “Motor on, O Hyperborean Wanderer. I wish I were ten or eleven again, with a beautiful day like this ahead of me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thanks for the books,” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No problem. That’s what we’re here for. Come on back sometime.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’d like to.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Well, you know where we are.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Yes</i>, Jake thought. <i class="calibre3">Now if I only knew where I am.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h14"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_13"><b class="calibre4">14</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    HE STOPPED JUST OUTSIDE the bookstore and flipped open the riddle book again, this time to page one, where there was a short uncredited introduction.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Riddles are perhaps the oldest of all the games people still play today,” it began. “The gods and goddesses of Greek myth teased each other with riddles, and they were employed as teaching tools in ancient Rome. The Bible contains several good riddles. One of the most famous of these was told by Samson on the day he was married to Delilah:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">‘Out of the eater came forth meat,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">and out of the strong came forth sweetness!</i>’
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx">
    “He asked this riddle of several young men who attended his wedding, confident that they wouldn’t be able to guess the answer. The young men, however, got Delilah aside and she whispered the answer to them. Samson was furious, and had the young men put to death for cheating—in the old days, you see, riddles were taken much more seriously than they are today!
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “By the way, the answer to Samson’s riddle—and all the other riddles in this book—can be found in the section at the back. We only ask that you give each puzzler a fair chance before you peek!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned to the back of the book, somehow knowing what he would find even before he got there. Beyond the page marked ANSWERS there was nothing but a few torn fragments and the back cover. The section had been ripped out.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stood there for a moment, thinking. Then, on an impulse that didn’t really feel like an impulse at all, Jake walked back inside The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Calvin Tower looked up from the chessboard. “Change your mind about that cup of coffee, O Hyperborean Wanderer?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. I wanted to ask you if you know the answer to a riddle.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fire away,” Tower invited, and moved a pawn.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Samson told it. The strong guy in the Bible? It goes like this—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ ‘Out of the eater came forth meat,’ ” said Aaron Deepneau, swinging around again to look at Jake, “ ‘and out of the strong came forth sweetness.’ That the one?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah, it is,” Jake said. “How’d you know—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, I’ve been around the block a time or two. Listen to this.” He threw his head back and sang in a full, melodious voice:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        “ ‘<i class="calibre3">Samson and a lion got in attack,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">And Samson climbed up on the lion’s back.</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">Well, you’ve read about lion killin men with their</i> <i class="calibre3">paws,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">But Samson put his hands round the lion’s jaws!</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">He rode that lion ’til the beast fell dead,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">And the bees made honey in the lion’s head.’”</i>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Aaron winked and then laughed at Jake’s surprised expression. “That answer your question, friend?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s eyes were wide. “Wow! Good song! Where’d you hear it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, Aaron knows them all,” Tower said. “He was hanging around Bleecker Street back before Bob Dylan knew how to blow more than open G on his Hohner. At least, if you believe <i class="calibre3">him</i>.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s an old spiritual,” Aaron said to Jake, and then to Tower: “By the way, you’re in check, fatso.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not for long,” Tower said. He moved his bishop. Aaron promptly bagged it. Tower muttered something under his breath. To Jake it sounded suspiciously like <i class="calibre3">fuckwad</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So the answer is a lion,” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Aaron shook his head. “Only <i class="calibre3">half</i> the answer. Samson’s Riddle is a <i class="calibre3">double</i>, my friend. The other half of the answer is honey. Get it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, I think so.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay, now try this one.” Aaron closed his eyes for a moment and then recited,

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">“What can run but never walks,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">Has a mouth but never talks,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">Has a bed but never sleeps,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">Has a head but never weeps?</i>”
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Smartass,” Tower growled at Aaron.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake thought it over, then shook his head. He could have worried it longer—he found this business of riddles both fascinating and charming—but he had a strong feeling that he ought to be moving on from here, that he had other business on Second Avenue this morning.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I give up.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No, you don’t,” Aaron said. “That’s what you do with <i class="calibre3">modern</i> riddles. But a <i class="calibre3">real</i> riddle isn’t just a joke, kiddo—it’s a puzzle. Turn it over in your head. If you still can’t get it, make it an excuse to come back another day. If you need another excuse, fatso here <i class="calibre3">does</i> make a pretty good cup of joe.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Okay,” Jake said. “Thanks. I will.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But as he left, a certainty stole over him: he would never enter The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind again.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h15"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_14"><b class="calibre4">15</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE WALKED SLOWLY DOWN Second Avenue, holding his new purchases in his left hand. At first he tried to think about the riddle—what <i class="calibre3">did</i> have a bed but never slept?—but little by little the question was driven from his mind by an increasing sense of anticipation. His senses seemed more acute than ever before in his life; he saw billions of coruscating sparks in the pavement, smelled a thousand mixed aromas in every breath he took, and seemed to hear other sounds, secret sounds, within each of the sounds he heard. He wondered if this was the way dogs felt before thunderstorms or earthquakes, and felt almost sure that it was. Yet the sensation that the impending event was not bad but good, that it would balance out the terrible thing which had happened to him three weeks ago, continued to grow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And now, as he drew close to the place where the course would be set, that knowing-in-advance fell upon him once again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">A bum is going to ask me for a handout, and I’ll give him the change Mr. Tower gave me. And there’s a record store. The door’s open to let in the fresh air and I’ll hear a Stones song playing when I pass. And I’m going to see my own reflection in a bunch of mirrors</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Traffic on Second Avenue was still light. Taxis honked and wove their way amid the slower-moving cars and trucks. Spring sunshine twinkled off their windshields and bright yellow hides. While he was waiting for a light to change, Jake saw the bum on the far corner of Second and Fifty-second. He was sitting against the brick wall of a small restaurant, and as Jake approached him, he saw that the name of the restaurant was Chew Chew Mama’s.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Choo-choo,</i> Jake thought. <i class="calibre3">And that’s the truth.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Godda-quarder?” the bum asked tiredly, and Jake dropped his change from the bookstore into the bum’s lap without even looking around. Now he could hear the Rolling Stones, right on schedule:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        “<i class="calibre3">I see a red door and I want to paint it black,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">No colours anymore, I want them to turn black</i> . . .”
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As he passed, he saw—also without surprise—that the name of the store was Tower of Power Records.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Towers were selling cheap today, it seemed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake walked on, the street-signs floating past in a kind of dream-daze. Between Forty-ninth and Forty-eighth he passed a store called Reflections of You. He turned his head and caught sight of a dozen Jakes in the mirrors, as he had known he would—a dozen boys who were small for their age, a dozen boys dressed in neat school clothes: blue blazers, white shirts, dark red ties, gray dress pants. Piper School didn’t have an official uniform, but this was as close to the unofficial one as you could get.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Piper seemed long ago and far away now.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Suddenly Jake realized where he was going. This knowledge rose in his mind like sweet, refreshing water from an underground spring. It’s a delicatessen, he thought. <i class="calibre3">That’s what it looks like, anyway. It’s really something else</i>—<i class="calibre3">a doorway to another world</i>. The <i class="calibre3">world. His world. The</i> right <i class="calibre3">world.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He began to run, looking ahead eagerly. The light at Forty-seventh was against him but he ignored it, leaping from the curb and racing nimbly between the broad white lines of the crosswalk with just a perfunctory glance to the left. A plumbing van stopped short with a squeal of tires as Jake flashed in front of it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hey! Whaddaya-whaddaya?” the driver yelled, but Jake ignored him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Only one more block.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He began to sprint all-out now. His tie fluttered behind his left shoulder; his hair had blown back from his forehead; his school loafers hammered the sidewalk. He ignored the stares—some amused, some merely curious—of the passersby as he had ignored the van driver’s outraged shout.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Up here</i>—<i class="calibre3">up here on the corner. Next to the stationery store</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Here came a UPS man in dark brown fatigues, pushing a dolly loaded with packages. Jake hurdled it like a long-jumper, arms up. The tail of his white shirt pulled free of his pants and flapped beneath his blazer like the hem of a slip. He came down and almost collided with a baby-carriage being pushed by a young Puerto Rican woman. Jake hooked around the pram like a halfback who has spotted a hole in the line and is bound for glory. “Where’s the fire, handsome?” the young woman asked, but Jake ignored her, too. He dashed past The Paper Patch, with its window-display of pens and notebooks and desk calculators.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The door!</i> he thought ecstatically. <i class="calibre3">I’m going to see it! And am I going to stop? No, way, José! I’m going to go straight through it, and if it’s locked, I’ll flatten it right in front of m</i>—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he saw what was at the corner of Second and Forty-sixth and stopped after all—skidded to a halt, in fact, on the heels of his loafers. He stood there in the middle of the sidewalk, hands clenched, his breath rasping harshly in and out of his lungs, his hair falling back onto his forehead in sweaty clumps.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” he almost whimpered. “<i class="calibre3">No!</i>” But his near-frantic negation did not change what he saw, which was nothing at all. There was nothing to see but a short board fence and a littered, weedy lot beyond it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The building which had stood there had been demolished.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h16"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_15"><b class="calibre4">16</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE STOOD OUTSIDE THE fence without moving for almost two minutes, surveying the vacant lot with dull eyes. One corner of his mouth twitched randomly. He could feel his hope, his <i class="calibre3">absolute certainty</i>, draining out of him. The feeling which was replacing it was the deepest, bitterest despair he had ever known.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Just another false alarm</i>, he thought when the shock had abated enough so he could think anything at all. <i class="calibre3">Another false alarm, blind alley, dry well</i>. <i class="calibre3">Now the voices will start up again, and when they do, I think I’m going to start screaming. And that’s okay. Because I’m tired of toughing this thing out. I’m tired of going crazy. If this is what going crazy is like, then I just want to hurry up and get there so somebody will take me to the hospital and give me something that’ll knock me out. I give up. This is the end of the line—I’m through.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But the voices did not come back—at least, not yet. And as he began to think about what he was seeing, he realized that the lot wasn’t completely empty, after all. Standing in the middle of the trash-littered, weedy waste ground was a sign.
  </div>

  <div class="chabox">
    <div class="ctag">
      MILLS CONSTRUCTION AND SOMBRA REAL ESTATE ASSOCIATES ARE CONTINUING TO REMAKE THE FACE OF MANHATTAN!

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Coming soon? Maybe . . . but Jake had his doubts. The letters on the sign were faded and it was sagging a little. At least one graffiti artist, BANGO SKANK by name, had left his mark across the artist’s drawing of the Turtle Bay Luxury Condominiums in bright blue spray-paint. Jake wondered if the project had been postponed or if it had maybe just gone belly-up. He remembered hearing his father talking on the telephone to his business advisor not two weeks ago, yelling at the man to stay away from any more condo investments. “I don’t <i class="calibre3">care</i> how good the tax-picture looks!” he’d nearly screamed (this was, so far as Jake could tell, his father’s normal tone of voice when discussing business matters—the coke in the desk drawer might have had something to do with that). “When they’re offering a goddamn TV set just so you’ll come down and look at a <i class="calibre3">blueprint</i>, something’s wrong!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The board fence surrounding the lot was chin-high to Jake. It had been plastered with handbills—Olivia Newton-John at Radio City, a group called G. Gordon Liddy and the Grots at a club in the East Village, a film called <i class="calibre3">War of the Zombies</i> which had come and gone earlier that spring. NO TRESPASSING signs had also been nailed up at intervals along the fence, but most of them had been papered over by ambitious bill-posters. A little way farther along, another graffito had been spray-painted on the fence—this one in what had once undoubtedly been a bright red but which had now faded to the dusky pink of late-summer roses. Jake whispered the words aloud, his eyes wide and fascinated:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        “See the TURTLE of enormous girth!<br class="calibre2"/>
        On his shell he holds the earth<br class="calibre2"/>

        Come along the BEAM today.”
      </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake supposed the source of this strange little poem (if not its meaning) was clear enough. This part of Manhattan’s East Side was known, after all, as Turtle Bay. But that didn’t explain the gooseflesh which was now running up the center of his back in a rough stripe, or his clear sense that he had found another road-sign along some fabulous hidden highway.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake unbuttoned his shirt and stuck his two newly purchased books inside. Then he looked around, saw no one paying attention to him, and grabbed the top of the fence. He boosted himself up, swung a leg over, and dropped down on the other side. His left foot landed on a loose pile of bricks that promptly slid out from under him. His ankle buckled under his weight and bright pain lanced up his leg. He fell with a thud and cried out in mingled hurt and surprise as more bricks dug into his ribcage like thick, rude fists.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He simply lay where he was for a moment, waiting to get his breath back. He didn’t think he was badly hurt, but he’d twisted his ankle and it would probably swell. He’d be walking with a limp by the time he got home. He’d just have to grin and bear it, though; he sure didn’t have cab-fare.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You don’t really plan to go home, do you? They’ll eat you alive.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Well, maybe they would and maybe they wouldn’t. So far as he could see, he didn’t have much choice in the matter. And that was for later. Right now he was going to explore this lot which had drawn him as surely as a magnet draws steel shavings. That feeling of power was still all around him, he realized, and stronger than ever. He didn’t think this was just a vacant lot. Something was going on here, something big. He could feel it thrumming in the air, like loose volts escaping from the biggest power-plant in the world.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As he got up, Jake saw that he had actually fallen lucky. Close by was a nasty jumble of broken glass. If he’d fallen into that, he might have cut himself very badly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That used to be the show window, Jake thought. When the deli was still here, you could stand on the sidewalk and look in at all the meats and cheeses. They used to hang them on strings</i>. He didn’t know how he knew this, but he did—knew it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked around thoughtfully and then walked a little farther into the lot. Near the middle, lying on the ground and half-buried in a lush growth of spring weeds, was another sign. Jake knelt beside it, pulled it upright, and brushed the dirt away. The letters were faded, but he could still make them out:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="ctag">
        TOM AND GERRY’S ARTISTIC DELI PARTY PLATTERS OUR SPECIALTY!
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And below it, spray-painted in that same red-fading-to-pink, was this puzzling sentence: HE HOLDS US ALL WITHIN HIS MIND.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">This is the place,</i> Jake thought. <i class="calibre3">Oh yes</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He let the sign fall back, stood up, and walked deeper into the lot, moving slowly, looking at everything. As he moved, that sensation of power grew. Everything he saw—the weeds, the broken glass, the clumps of bricks—seemed to stand forth with a kind of exclamatory force. Even the potato chip bags seemed beautiful, and the sun had turned a discarded beer-bottle into a cylinder of brown fire.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake was very aware of his own breathing, and of the sunlight falling upon everything like a weight of gold. He suddenly understood that he was standing on the edge of a great mystery, and he felt a shudder—half terror and half wonder—work through him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s all here. Everything. Everything is still here.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The weeds brushed at his pants; burdocks stuck to his socks. The breeze blew a Ring-Ding wrapper in front of him; the sun reflected off it and for a moment the wrapper was filled with a beautiful, terrible inner glow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Everything is still here,” he repeated to himself, unaware that his face was filling with its own inner glow. “<i class="calibre3">Everything.</i> ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was hearing a sound—had been hearing it ever since he entered the lot, in fact. It was a wonderful high humming, inexpressibly lonely and inexpressibly lovely. It might have been the sound of a high wind on a deserted plain, except it was <i class="calibre3">alive.</i> It was, he thought, the sound of a thousand voices singing some great open chord. He looked down and realized there were <i class="calibre3">faces</i> in the tangled weeds and low bushes and heaps of bricks. <i class="calibre3">Faces</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What are you?” Jake whispered. “<i class="calibre3">Who</i> are you?” There was no answer, but he seemed to hear, beneath the choir, the sound of hoofbeats on the dusty earth, and gunfire, and angels calling hosannahs from the shadows. The faces in the wreckage seemed to turn as he passed. They seemed to follow his progress, but no evil intent did they bear. He could see Forty-sixth Street, and the edge of the U.N. Building on the other side of First Avenue, but the buildings did not matter—<i class="calibre3">New York</i> did not matter. It had become as pale as window-glass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The humming grew. Now it was not a thousand voices but a million, an open funnel of voices rising from the deepest well of the universe. He caught names in that group voice, but could not have said what they were. One might have been Marten. One might have been Cuthbert. Another might have been Roland—Roland of Gilead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There were names; there was a babble of conversation that might have been ten thousand entwined stories; but above all was that gorgeous, swelling hum, a vibration that wanted to fill his head with bright white light. It was, Jake realized with a joy so overwhelming that it threatened to burst him to pieces, the voice of <i class="calibre3">Yes</i>; the voice of <i class="calibre3">White</i>; the voice of <i class="calibre3">Always</i>. It was a great chorus of affirmation, and it sang in the empty lot. It sang for him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then, lying in a cluster of scrubby burdock plants, Jake saw the key . . . and beyond that, the rose.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h17"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_16"><b class="calibre4">17</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    HIS LEGS BETRAYED HIM and he fell to his knees. He was vaguely aware that he was weeping, even more vaguely aware that he had wet his pants a little. He crawled forward on his knees and reached toward the key lying in the snarl of burdocks. Its simple shape was one he seemed to have seen in his dreams:

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="010" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00010.jpeg"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He thought: <i class="calibre3">The little</i> s<i class="calibre3">-shape at the end—that’s the secret.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As he closed his hand around the key, the voices rose in a harmonic shout of triumph. Jake’s own cry was lost in the voice of that choir. He saw the key flash white within his fingers, and felt a tremendous jolt of power run up his arm. It was as if he had grasped a live high-tension wire, but there was no pain.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He opened <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> and put the key inside. Then his eyes fixed upon the rose again, and he realized that it was the <i class="calibre3">real</i> key—the key to everything. He crawled toward it, his face a flaming corona of light, his eyes blazing wells of blue fire.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The rose was growing from a clump of alien purple grass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As Jake neared this clump of alien grass, the rose began to open before his eyes. It disclosed a dark scarlet furnace, petal upon secret petal, each burning with its own secret fury. He had never seen anything so intensely and utterly alive in his whole life.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And now, as he stretched one grimy hand out toward this wonder, the voices began to sing his own name . . . and deadly fear began to steal in toward the center of his heart. It was as cold as ice and as heavy as stone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was something wrong. He could feel a pulsing discord, like a deep and ugly scratch across some priceless work of art or a deadly fever smouldering beneath the chilly skin of an invalid’s brow.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was something like a worm. An invading worm. And a shape. One which lurks just beyond the next turn of the road.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the heart of the rose opened for him, exposing a yellow dazzle of light, and all thought was swept away on a wave of wonder. Jake thought for a moment that what he was seeing was only pollen which had been invested with the supernatural glow which lived at the heart of every object in this deserted clearing—he thought it even though he had never heard of pollen within a rose. He leaned closer and saw that the concentrated circle of blazing yellow was not pollen at all. <i class="calibre3">It was a sun:</i> a vast forge burning at the center of this rose growing in the purple grass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The fear returned, only now it had become outright terror. <i class="calibre3">It’s right,</i> he thought, <i class="calibre3">everything here is right, but it could go wrong—has started going wrong already, I think. I’m being allowed to feel as much of that wrongness as I can bear . . . but what is it? And what can I do?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was something like a worm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He could feel it beating like a sick and dirty heart, warring with the serene beauty of the rose, screaming harsh profanities against the choir of voices which had so soothed and lifted him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He leaned closer to the rose and saw that its core was not just one sun but many . . . perhaps all suns contained within a ferocious yet fragile shell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">But it’s wrong. It’s all in danger.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Knowing it would almost surely mean his death to touch that glowing microcosm but helpless to stop himself, Jake reached forward. There was no curiosity or terror in this gesture; only a great, inarticulate need to protect the rose.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h18"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_17"><b class="calibre4">18</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    WHEN HE CAME BACK to himself, he was at first only aware that a great deal of time had passed and his head hurt like hell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">What happened? Was I mugged?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He rolled over and sat up. Another blast of pain went through his head. He raised a hand to his left temple, and his fingers came away sticky with blood. He looked down and saw a brick poking out of the weeds. Its rounded corner was too red.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">If it had been sharp, I’d probably be dead or in a coma.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked at his wrist and was surprised to find he was still wearing his watch. It was a Seiko, not terribly expensive, but in this city you didn’t snooze in vacant lots without losing your stuff. Expensive or not, someone would be more than happy to relieve you of it. This time he had been lucky, it seemed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was quarter past four in the afternoon. He had been lying here, dead to the world, for at least five hours. His father probably had the cops out looking for him by now, but that didn’t seem to matter much. It seemed to Jake that he had walked out of Piper School about a thousand years ago.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake walked half the distance to the fence between the vacant lot and the Second Avenue sidewalk, then stopped.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    What exactly <i class="calibre3">had</i> happened to him?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Little by little, the memories came back. Hopping the fence. Slipping and twisting his ankle. He reached down, touched it, and winced. Yes—that much had happened, all right. Then what?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Something magical.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He groped for that something like an old man groping his way across a shadowy room. Everything had been full of its own light. <i class="calibre3">Everything</i>—even the empty wrappers and discarded beer-bottles. There had been voices—they had been singing and telling thousands of overlapping stories.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And <i class="calibre3">faces</i>,” he muttered. This memory made him look around apprehensively. He saw no faces. The piles of bricks were just piles of bricks, and the tangles of weeds were just tangles of weeds. There were no faces, but—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">—but they were here. It wasn’t your imagination.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He believed that. He couldn’t capture the essence of the memory, its quality of beauty and transcendence, but it seemed perfectly real. It was just that his memory of those moments before he had passed out seemed like photographs taken on the best day of your life. You can remember what that day was like—sort of, anyway—but the pictures are flat and almost powerless.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked around the desolate lot, now filling up with the violet shadows of late afternoon, and thought: <i class="calibre3">I want you back. God, I want you back the way you were.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he saw the rose, growing in its clump of purple grass, very close to the place where he had fallen. His heart leaped into his throat. Jake blundered back toward it, unmindful of the beats of pain each step sent up from his ankle. He dropped to his knees in front of it like a worshipper at an altar. He leaned forward, eyes wide.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s just a rose. Just a rose after all. And the grass—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The grass wasn’t purple after all, he saw. There were splatters of purple on the blades, yes, but the color beneath was a perfectly normal green. He looked a little further and saw splashes of blue on another clump of weeds. To his right, a straggling burdock bush bore traces of both red and yellow. And beyond the burdocks was a little pile of discarded paint-cans. Glidden Spread Satin, the labels said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That’s all it was. Just splatters of paint. Only with your head all messed up the way it was, you thought you were seeing—</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That was bullshit.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He knew what he had seen then, and what he was seeing now. “Camouflage,” he whispered. “It was all right here. <i class="calibre3">Everything</i> was. And . . . it still is.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now that his head was clearing, he could again feel the steady, harmonic power that this place held. The choir was still here, its voice just as musical, although now dim and distant. He looked at a pile of bricks and old broken chunks of plaster and saw a barely discernible face hiding within it. It was the face of a woman with a scar on her forehead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Allie?” Jake murmured. “Isn’t your name Allie?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no answer. The face was gone. He was only looking at an unlovely pile of bricks and plaster again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He looked back at the rose. It was, he saw, not the dark red that lives at the heart of a blazing furnace, but a dusty, mottled pink. It was very beautiful, but not perfect. Some of the petals had curled back; the outer edges of these were brown and dead. It wasn’t the sort of cultivated flower he had seen in florists’ shops; he supposed it was a wild rose.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re very beautiful,” he said, and once more stretched his hand out to touch it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Although there was no breeze, the rose nodded toward him. For just a moment the pads of his fingers touched its surface, smooth and velvety and marvellously alive, and all around him the voice of the choir seemed to swell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you sick, rose?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no answer, of course. When his fingers left the faded pink bowl of the flower, it nodded back to its original position, growing out of the paint-splattered weeds in its quiet, forgotten splendor.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Do roses bloom at this time of year? Jake wondered. Wild ones? Why would a wild rose grow in a vacant lot, anyway? And if there’s one, how come there aren’t more?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He remained on his hands and knees a little longer, then realized he could stay here looking at the rose for the rest of the afternoon (or maybe the rest of his life) and not come any closer to solving its mystery. He had seen it plain for a moment, as he had seen everything else in this forgotten, trash-littered corner of the city; he had seen it with its mask off and its camouflage tossed aside. He wanted to see that again, but wanting would not make it so.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was time to go home.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He saw the two books he’d bought at The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind lying nearby. As he picked them up, a bright silver object slipped from the pages of <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> and fell into a scruffy patch of weeds. Jake bent, favoring his hurt ankle, and picked it up. As he did so, the choir seemed to sigh and swell, then fell back to its almost inaudible hum.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So that part was real, too,” he murmured. He ran the ball of his thumb over the blunt protruding points of the key and into those primitive V-shaped notches. He sent it skating over the mild <i class="calibre3">s</i>-curves at the end of the third notch. Then he tucked it deep into the right front pocket of his pants and began to limp back toward the fence.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had reached it and was preparing to scramble over the top when a terrible thought suddenly seized his mind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The rose! What if somebody comes in here and picks it?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A little moan of horror escaped him. He turned back and after a moment his eyes picked it out, although it was deep in the shadow of a neighboring building now—a tiny pink shape in the dimness, vulnerable, beautiful, and alone.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I can’t leave it—I have to guard it!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But a voice spoke up in his mind, a voice that was surely that of the man he had met at the way station in that strange other life. <i class="calibre3">No one will pick it. Nor will any vandal crush it beneath his heel because his dull eyes cannot abide the sight of its beauty. That is not the danger. It can protect itself from such things as those.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A sense of deep relief swept through Jake.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Can I come here again and look at it?</i> he asked the phantom voice<i class="calibre3">. When I’m low, or if the voices come back and start their argument again? Can I come back and look at it and have some peace?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The voice did not answer, and after a few moments of listening, Jake decided it was gone. He tucked <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo and Riddle-De-Dum</i>! into the waistband of his pants—which, he saw, were streaked with dirt and dotted with clinging burdocks—and then grabbed the board fence. He boosted himself up, swung over the top, and dropped onto the sidewalk of Second Avenue again, being careful to land on his good foot.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Traffic on the Avenue—both pedestrian and vehicular—was much heavier now as people made their way home for the night. A few passersby looked at the dirty boy in the torn blazer and untucked, flapping shirt as he jumped awkwardly down from the fence, but not many. New Yorkers are used to the sight of people doing peculiar things.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He stood there a moment, feeling a sense of loss and realizing something else, as well—the arguing voices were still absent. That, at least, was something.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He glanced at the board fence; and the verse of spray-painted doggerel seemed to leap out at him, perhaps because the paint was the same color as the rose.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “See the TURTLE of enormous girth” Jake muttered. “On his shell he holds the earth.” He shivered. “What a day! Boy!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned and began to limp slowly in the direction of home.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h19"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_18"><b class="calibre4">19</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE DOORMAN MUST HAVE buzzed up as soon as Jake entered the lobby, because his father was standing outside the elevator when it opened on the fifth floor. Elmer Chambers was wearing faded jeans and cowboy boots that improved his five-ten to a rootin, tootin six feet. His black, crewcut hair bolted up from his head; for as long as Jake could remember, his father had looked like a man who had just suffered some tremendous, galvanizing shock. As soon as Jake stepped out of the elevator, Chambers seized him by the arm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Look at you!” His father’s eyes flicked up and down, taking in Jake’s dirty face and hands, the blood drying on his cheek and temple, the dusty pants, the torn blazer, and the burdock that clung to his tie like some peculiar clip. “Get in here! Where the hell have you been? Your mother’s just about off her fucking gourd!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Without giving Jake a chance to answer, he dragged him through the apartment door. Jake saw Greta Shaw standing in the archway between the dining room and the kitchen. She gave him a look of guarded sympathy, then disappeared before the eyes of “the mister” could chance upon her.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s mother was sitting in her rocker. She got to her feet when she saw Jake, but she did not leap to her feet; neither did she pelt across to the foyer so she could cover him with kisses and invective. As she came toward him, Jake assessed her eyes and guessed she’d had at least three Valium since noon. Maybe four. Both of his parents were firm believers in better living through chemistry.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re <i class="calibre3">bleeding</i>! Where have you been?” She made this inquiry in her cultured Vassar voice, pronouncing <i class="calibre3">been</i> so it rhymed with seen. She might have been greeting an acquaintance who had been involved in a minor traffic accident.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Out,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father gave him a rough shake. Jake wasn’t prepared for it. He stumbled and came down on his bad ankle. The pain flared again, and he was suddenly furious. Jake didn’t think his father was pissed because he had disappeared from school, leaving only his mad composition behind; his father was pissed because Jake had had the temerity to fuck up his own precious schedule.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    To this point in his life, Jake had been aware of only three feelings about his father: puzzlement, fear, and a species of weak, confused love. Now a fourth and fifth surfaced. One was anger; the other was disgust. Mixed in with these unpleasant feelings was that sense of homesickness. It was the largest thing inside him right now, weaving through everything else like smoke. He looked at his father’s flushed cheeks and screaming haircut and wished he was back in the vacant lot, looking at the rose and listening to the choir. <i class="calibre3">This is not my place</i>, he thought. <i class="calibre3">Not anymore</i>. <i class="calibre3">I have work to do. If only I knew what it was.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let go of me,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">What</i> did you say to me?” His father’s blue eyes widened. They were very bloodshot tonight. Jake guessed he had been dipping heavily into his supply of magic powder, and that probably made this a bad time to cross him, but Jake realized he intended to cross him just the same. He would not be shaken like a mouse in the jaws of a sadistic tomcat. Not tonight. Maybe not ever again. He suddenly realized that a large part of his anger stemmed from one simple fact: he could not <i class="calibre3">talk</i> to them about what had happened—what was <i class="calibre3">still</i> happening. They had closed all the doors.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">But I have a key,</i> he thought, and touched its shape through the fabric of his pants. And the rest of that strange verse occurred to him: <i class="calibre3">If you want to run and play,/Come along the BEAM today.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I said let go of me,” he repeated. “I’ve got a sprained ankle and you’re hurting it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll hurt more than your ankle if you don’t—” Sudden strength seemed to flow into Jake. He seized the hand clamped on his arm just below the shoulder and shoved it violently away. His father’s mouth dropped open.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t <i class="calibre3">work</i> for you,” Jake said. “I’m your <i class="calibre3">son</i>, remember? If you forgot, check the picture on your desk.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father’s upper lip pulled back from his perfectly capped teeth in a snarl that was two parts surprise and one part fury. “Don’t you talk to me like that, mister—where in the hell is your respect?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know. Maybe I lost it on the way home.”

  <div class="tx1">
    “You spend the whole goddamn day absent without leave and then you stand there running your fat, disrespectful mouth—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stop it! Stop it, both of you!” Jake’s mother cried. She sounded near tears in spite of the tranquilizers perking through her system.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s father reached for Jake’s arm again, then changed his mind. The surprising force with which his son had torn his hand away a moment ago might have had something to do with it. Or perhaps it was only the look in Jake’s eyes. “I want to know where you’ve been. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Out. I told you that. And that’s <i class="calibre3">all</i> I’m going to tell you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fuck that! Your headmaster called, your French teacher actually <i class="calibre3">came here,</i> and they both had <i class="calibre3">beaucoup</i> questions for you! So do I, and I want some <i class="calibre3">answers!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Your clothes are dirty,” his mother observed, and then added timidly: “Were you mugged, Johnny? Did you play hookey and get mugged?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Of course he wasn’t mugged,” Elmer Chambers snarled. “Still wearing his watch, isn’t he?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But there’s blood on his head.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s okay, Mom. I just bumped it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m going to go to bed. I’m very, very tired. If you want to talk about this in the morning, okay. Maybe we’ll all be able to make some sense then. But for now, I don’t have a thing to say.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father took a step after him, reaching out.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No, <i class="calibre3">Elmer!</i>” Jake’s mother almost screamed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Chambers ignored her. He grabbed Jake by the back of the blazer. “Don’t you just walk away from me—” he began, and then Jake whirled, tearing the blazer out of his hand. The seam under the right arm, already strained, let go with a rough purring sound.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father saw those blazing eyes and stepped away. The rage on his face was doused by something that looked like terror. That blaze was not metaphorical; Jake’s eyes actually seemed to be on fire. His mother gave voice to a strengthless little scream, clapped one hand to her mouth, took two large, stumbling steps backward, and dropped into her rocking chair with a small thud.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Leave . . . me . . . alone,</i>” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s <i class="calibre3">happened</i> to you?” his father asked, and now his tone was almost plaintive. “What in the <i class="calibre3">hell’s</i> happened to you? You bug out of school without a word to anyone on the first day of exams, you come back filthy from head to toe . . . and you act as if you’ve gone crazy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Well, there it was—<i class="calibre3">you act as if you’ve gone crazy</i>. What he’d been afraid of ever since the voices started three weeks ago. The Dread Accusation. Only now that it was out, Jake found it didn’t frighten him much at all, perhaps because he had finally put the issue to rest in his own mind. Yes, something had happened to him. Was still happening. But no—he had <i class="calibre3">not</i> gone crazy. At least, not yet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We’ll talk about it in the morning,” he repeated. He walked across the dining room, and this time his father didn’t try to stop him. He had almost reached the hall when his mother’s voice, worried, stopped him: “Johnny . . . <i class="calibre3">are</i> you all right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And what should he answer? Yes? No? Both of the above? Neither of the above? But the voices had stopped, and that was something. That was, in fact, quite a lot.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Better,” he said at last. He went down to his room and closed the door firmly behind him. The sound of the door snicking firmly shut between him and all the rest of the round world filled him with tremendous relief.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h20"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_19"><b class="calibre4">20</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    HE STOOD BY THE door for a little while, listening. His mother’s voice was only a murmur, his father’s voice a little louder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His mother said something about blood, and a doctor.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father said the kid was fine; the only thing wrong with the kid was the junk coming out of his mouth, and he would fix that.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His mother said something about calming down.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father said he <i class="calibre3">was</i> calm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His mother said—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He said, she said, blah, blah, blah. Jake still loved them—he was pretty sure he did, anyway—but other stuff had happened now, and these things had made it necessary that still other things must occur.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Why? Because something was wrong with the rose. And maybe because he wanted to run and play . . . and see <i class="calibre3">his</i> eyes again, as blue as the sky above the way station had been.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake walked slowly over to his desk, removing his blazer as he went. It was pretty wasted—one sleeve torn almost completely off, the lining hanging like a limp sail. He slung it over the back of his chair, then sat down and put the books on his desk. He had been sleeping very badly over the last week and a half, but he thought tonight he would sleep well. He couldn’t remember ever being so tired. When he woke up in the morning, perhaps he would know what to do.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a light knock at the door, and Jake turned warily in that direction.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s Mrs. Shaw, John. May I come in for a minute?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He smiled. Mrs. Shaw—of course it was. His parents had drafted her as an intermediary. Or perhaps translator might be a better word.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">You go see him,</i> his mother would have said. <i class="calibre3">He’ll tell you what’s wrong with him. I’m his mother and this man with the bloodshot eyes and the runny nose is his father and you’re only the housekeeper, but he’ll tell you what he wouldn’t tell us. Because you see more of him than either of us, and maybe you speak his language.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">She’ll have a tray,</i> Jake thought, and when he opened the door he was smiling.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mrs. Shaw did indeed have a tray. There were two sandwiches on it, a wedge of apple pie, and a glass of chocolate milk. She was looking at Jake with mild anxiety, as if she thought he might lunge forward and try to bite her. Jake looked over her shoulder, but there was no sign of his parents. He imagined them sitting in the living room, listening anxiously.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I thought you might like something to eat,” Mrs. Shaw said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, thanks.” In fact, he was ravenously hungry; he hadn’t eaten since breakfast. He stood aside and Mrs. Shaw came in (giving him another apprehensive look as she passed) and put the tray on the desk.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, look at this,” she said, picking up <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo.</i> “I had this one when I was a little girl. Did you buy this today, Johnny?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Did my parents ask you to find out what I’d been up to?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She nodded. No acting, no put-on. It was just a chore, like taking out the trash. <i class="calibre3">You can tell me if you want to</i>, her face said, <i class="calibre3">or you can keep still. I like you, Johnny, but it’s really nothing to me, one way or the other. I just work here, and it’s already an hour past my regular quitting time.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was not offended by what her face had to say; on the contrary, he was further calmed by it. Mrs. Shaw was another acquaintance who was not quite a friend . . . but he thought she might be a little closer to a friend than any of the kids at school were, and much closer than either his mother or father. Mrs. Shaw was honest, at least. She didn’t dance. It all went on the bill at the end of the month, and she <i class="calibre3">always</i> cut the crusts off the sandwiches.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake picked up a sandwich and took a large bite. Bologna and cheese, his favorite. That was another thing in Mrs. Shaw’s favor—she knew all his favorites. His mother was still under the impression that he liked corn on the cob and hated brussels sprouts.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Please tell them I’m fine,” he said, “and tell my father I’m sorry that I was rude to him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He wasn’t, but all his father really wanted was that apology. Once Mrs. Shaw conveyed it to him, he would relax and begin to tell himself the old lie—he had done his fatherly duty and all was well, all was well, and all manner of things were well.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ve been studying very hard for my exams,” he said, chewing as he talked, “and it all came down on me this morning, I guess. I sort of froze. It seemed like I had to get out or I’d suffocate.” He touched the dried crust of blood on his forehead. “As for this, please tell my mother it’s really nothing. I didn’t get mugged or anything; it was just a stupid accident. There was a UPS guy pushing a hand-truck, and I walked right into it. The cut’s no big deal. I’m not having double vision or anything, and even the headache’s gone now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She nodded. “I can see how it must have been—a high-powered school like that and all. You just got a little spooked. No shame in that, Johnny. But you really <i class="calibre3">haven’t</i> seemed like yourself this last couple of weeks. ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I think I’ll be okay now. I might have to re-do my Final Essay in English, but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh!” Mrs. Shaw said. A startled looked crossed her face. She put <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> back down on Jake’s desk. “I almost forgot! Your French teacher left something for you. I’ll just get it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She left the room. Jake hoped he hadn’t worried Mr. Bissette, who was a pretty good guy, but he supposed he must have, since Bissette had actually made a personal appearance. Jake had an idea that personal appearances were pretty rare for Piper School teachers. He wondered what Mr. Bissette had left. His best guess was an invitation to talk with Mr. Hotchkiss, the school shrink. That would have scared him this morning, but not tonight.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tonight only the rose seemed to matter.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He tore into his second sandwich. Mrs. Shaw had left the door open, and he could hear her talking with his parents. They both sounded a little more cooled out now. Jake drank his milk, then grabbed the plate with the apple pie on it. A few moments later Mrs. Shaw came back. She was carrying a very familiar blue folder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake found that not all of his dread had left him after all. They would all know by now, of course, students and faculty alike, and it was too late to do anything about it, but that didn’t mean he liked all of them knowing he had flipped his lid. That they were talking about him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A small envelope had been paper-clipped to the front of the folder. Jake pulled it free and looked up at Mrs. Shaw as he opened it. “How are my folks doing now?” he asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She allowed herself a brief smile. “Your father wanted me to ask why you didn’t just tell him you had Exam Fever. He said he had it himself once or twice when he was a boy.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake was struck by this; his father had never been the sort of man to indulge in reminiscences which began, <i class="calibre3">You know, when I was a kid . . .</i> Jake tried to imagine his father as a boy with a bad case of Exam Fever and found he couldn’t quite do it—the best he could manage was the unpleasant image of a pugnacious dwarf in a Piper sweatshirt, a dwarf in custom-tooled cowboy boots, a dwarf with short black hair bolting up from his forehead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The note was from Mr. Bissette.
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx">
      <i class="calibre3">Dear John,</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Bonnie Avery told me that you left early. She’s very concerned about you, and so am I, although we have both seen this sort of thing before, especially during Exam Week. Please come and see me first thing tomorrow, okay? Any problems you have can be worked out. If you’re feeling pressured by exams<b class="calibre4">—</b>and I want to repeat that it happens all the time—a postponement can be arranged. Our first concern is your welfare. Call me this evening, if you like; you can reach me at 555-7661. I’ll be up until midnight.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Remember that we all like you very much, and are on your side.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx">
      <i class="calibre3">À votre santé</i>
    </div>

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="011" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00011.gif"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake felt like crying. The concern was stated, and that was wonderful, but there were other things, unstated things, in the note that were even more wonderful—warmth, caring, and an effort (however misconceived) to understand and console.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Bissette had drawn a small arrow at the bottom of the note. Jake turned it over and read this:
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">By the way, Bonnie asked me to send this along—congratulations!!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Congratulations? What in the hell did that mean?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He flipped open the folder. A sheet of paper had been clipped to the first page of his Final Essay. It was headed FROM THE DESK OF BONITA AVERY, and Jake read the spiky, fountain-penned lines with growing amazement.
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx">
      <i class="calibre3">John,</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Leonard will undoubtedly voice the concern we all feel—he is awfully good at that—so let me confine myself to your Final Essay, which I read and graded during my free period. It is stunningly original, and superior to any student work I have read in the last few years. Your use of incremental repetition (“. . . and that is the truth”) is inspired, but of course incremental repetition is really just a trick. The real worth of the composition is in its symbolic quality, first stated by the images of the train and the door on the title page and carried through splendidly within. This reaches its logical conclusion with the picture of the “black tower,” which I take as your statement that conventional ambitions are not only false but dangerous.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">I do not pretend to understand all the symbolism (e.g., “Lady of Shadows,” “gunslinger”) but it seems clear that you yourself are “The Prisoner</i>” <i class="calibre3">(of school, society, etc.) and that the educational system is “The Speaking Demon.” Is it possible that both “Roland” and “the gunslinger” are the same authority figure—your father, perhaps? I became so intrigued by this possibility that I looked up his name in your records. I note it is Elmer, but I further note that his middle initial is R.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">I find this extremely provocative. Or is this name a double symbol, drawn both from your father and from</i> Robert <i class="calibre3">Browning’s poem “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came”? This is not a question I would ask most students, but of course I know how omnivorously you read!</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">At any rate, I am extremely impressed. Younger students are often attracted to so-called “stream-of-consciousness” writing, but are rarely able to control it. You have done an outstanding job of merging s-of-c with symbolic language.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Bravo!</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Drop by as soon as you’re “back at it”—I want to discuss possible publication of this piece in the first issue of next year’s student literary magazine.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx">
      <i class="calibre3">B. Avery</i>
    </div>

    <div class="calibre2">
      <br class="calibre2"/>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">P.S. If you left school today because you had sudden doubts about my ability to understand a Final Essay of such unexpected richness, I hope I have assuaged them.</i>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake pulled the sheet off the clip, revealing the title page of his stunningly original and richly symbolic Final Essay. Written and circled there in the red ink of Ms. Avery’s marking pen was the notation A + . Below this she had written <i class="calibre3">EXCELLENT JOB!!!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake began to laugh.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The whole day—the long, scary, confusing, exhilarating, terrifying, mysterious day—was condensed in great, roaring sobs of laughter. He slumped in his chair, head thrown back, hands clutching his belly, tears streaming down his face. He laughed himself hoarse. He would almost stop and then some line from Ms. Avery’s well-meaning critique would catch his eye and he would be off to the races again. He didn’t see his father come to the door, look in at him with puzzled, wary eyes, and then leave again. shaking his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At last he <i class="calibre3">did</i> become aware that Mrs. Shaw was still sitting on his bed, looking at him with an expression of friendly detachment tinctured with faint curiosity. He tried to speak, but the laughter pealed out again before he could.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I gotta stop, he thought. I gotta stop or it’s gonna kill me. I’ll have a stroke or a heart attack, or something.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he thought, <i class="calibre3">I wonder what she made of “choo-choo</i> , <i class="calibre3">choo-choo?,</i> ” and he began to laugh wildly again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At last the spasms began to taper off to giggles. He wiped his arm across his streaming eyes and said, “I’m sorry, Mrs. Shaw—it’s just that . . . well . . . I got an A-plus on my Final Essay. It was all very . . . very rich . . . and very sym . . . sym . . .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But he couldn’t finish. He doubled up with laughter again, holding his throbbing belly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mrs. Shaw got up, smiling. “That’s very nice, John. I’m happy it’s all turned out so well, and I’m sure your folks will be, too. I’m awfully late—I think I’ll ask the doorman to call me a cab. Goodnight, and sleep well.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Goodnight, Mrs. Shaw,” Jake said, controlling himself with an effort. “And thanks.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    As soon as she was gone, he began to laugh again.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_20"><b class="calibre4">21</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    DURING THE NEXT HALF hour he had separate visits from both parents. They had indeed calmed down, and the A + grade on Jake’s Final Essay seemed to calm them further. Jake received them with his French text open on the desk before him, but he hadn’t really looked at it, nor did he have any intention of looking at it. He was only waiting for them to be gone so he could study the two books he had bought earlier that day. He had an idea that the <i class="calibre3">real</i> Final Exams were still waiting just over the horizon, and he wanted desperately to pass.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father poked his head into Jake’s room around quarter of ten, about twenty minutes after Jake’s mother had concluded her own short, vague visit. Elmer Chambers was holding a cigarette in one hand and a glass of Scotch in the other. He seemed not only calmer but almost zonked. Jake wondered briefly and indifferently if he had been hitting his mother’s Valium supply.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Are you okay, kid?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.” He was once again the small, neat boy who was always completely in control of himself. The eyes he turned to his father were not blazing but opaque.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I wanted to say I’m sorry about before.” His father was not a man who made many apologies, and he did it badly. Jake found himself feeling a little sorry for him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s all right.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hard day,” his father said. He gestured with the empty glass. “Why don’t we just forget it happened?” He spoke as if this great and logical idea had just come to him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I already have.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Good.” His father sounded relieved. “Time for you to get some sleep, isn’t it? You’ll have some explaining to do and some tests to take tomorrow.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I guess so,” Jake said. “Is Mom okay?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fine. Fine. I’m going in the study. Got a lot of paperwork tonight.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Dad?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    His father looked back at him warily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s your middle name?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Something in his father’s face told Jake that he had looked at the Final Essay grade but hadn’t bothered to read either the paper itself or Ms. Avery’s critique.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t have one,” he said. “Just an initial, like Harry S Truman. Except mine’s an R. What brought that on?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Just curious,” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He managed to hold onto his composure until his father was gone . . . but as soon as the door was closed, he ran to his bed and stuffed his face into his pillow to muffle another bout of wild laughter.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_21"><b class="calibre4">22</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    WHEN HE WAS SURE he was over the current fit (although an occasional snicker still rumbled up his throat like an aftershock) and his father would be safely locked away in his study with his cigarettes, his Scotch, his papers, and his little bottle of white powder, Jake went back to his desk, turned on the study lamp, and opened <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo.</i> He glanced briefly at the copyright page and saw it had originally been published in 1942; his copy was from the fourth printing. He looked at the back, but there was no information at all about Beryl Evans, the book’s author.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake turned back to the beginning, looked at the picture of a grinning, blonde-haired man sitting in the cab of a steam locomotive, considered the proud grin on the man’s face, and then began to read.
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx1">
      Bob Brooks was an engineer for The Mid-World Railway Company, on the St. Louis to Topeka run. Engineer Bob was the best trainman The Mid-World Railway Company ever had, and Charlie was the best train!
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Charlie was a 402 Big Boy Steam Locomotive, and Engineer Bob was the only man who had ever been allowed to sit in his peak-seat and pull the whistle. Everyone knew the WHOOO-OOOO of Charlie’s whistle, and whenever they heard it echoing across the flat Kansas countryside, they said, “There goes Charlie and Engineer Bob, the fastest team between St. Louis and Topeka!”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Boys and girls ran into their yards to watch Charlie and Engineer Bob go by. Engineer Bob would smile and wave. The children would smile and wave back.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Engineer Bob had a special secret. He was the only one who knew. Charlie the Choo-Choo was really, really alive. One day while they were making the run between Topeka and St. Louis, Engineer Bob heard singing, very soft and low.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Who is in the cab with me?” Engineer Bob said sternly.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You need to see a shrink, Engineer Bob,” Jake murmured, and turned the page. Here was a picture of Bob bending over to look beneath Charlie the Choo-Choo’s automatic firebox. Jake wondered who was driving the train and watching out for cows (not to mention boys and girls) on the tracks while Bob was checking for stowaways, and guessed that Beryl Evans hadn’t known a lot about trains.
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx1">
      “Don’t worry,” said a small, gruff voice. “It is only I.”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Who’s I?” Engineer Bob asked. He spoke in his biggest, sternest voice, because he still thought someone was playing a joke on him.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Charlie,” said the small, gruff voice.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Hardy har-har!” said Engineer Bob. “Trains can’t talk! I may not know much, but I know that! If you’re Charlie, I suppose you can blow your own whistle!”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Of course,” said the small, gruff voice, and just then the whistle made its big noise, rolling out across the Missouri plains: WHOOO-OOOO!
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Goodness!” said Engineer Bob. “It really is you!”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “I told you,” said Charlie the Choo-Choo.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “How come I never knew you were alive before?” asked Engineer Bob. “Why didn’t you ever talk to me before?”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Then Charlie sang this song to Engineer Bob in his small, gruff voice.
    </div>

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">Don’t ask me silly questions,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I won’t play silly games.</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I’m just a simple choo-choo train</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">And I’ll always be the same.</i>

        <i class="calibre3">Until the day I die.</i>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Will you talk to me some more when we’re making our run?” asked Engineer Bob. “I’d like that.”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “I would, too,” said Charlie. “I love you, Engineer Bob. ”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “I love you too, Charlie,” said Engineer Bob, and then he blew the whistle himself, just to show how happy he was.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      WHOOO-OOO! It was the biggest and best Charlie had <i class="calibre3">ever</i> whistled, and everyone who heard it came out to see.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The picture which illustrated this last was similar to the one on the cover of the book. In the previous pictures (they were rough drawings which reminded Jake of the pictures in his favorite kindergarten book, <i class="calibre3">Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel</i>)<i class="calibre3">,</i> the locomotive had been just a locomotive—cheery, undoubtedly interesting to the ’40s-era boys who had been this book’s intended audience, but still only a piece of machinery. In this picture, however, it had clearly human features, and this gave Jake a deep chill despite Charlie’s smile and the rather heavy-handed cuteness of the story.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He didn’t trust that smile.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned to his Final Essay and scanned down the lines. <i class="calibre3">I’m pretty sure Blaine is dangerous, he read, and that is the truth.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He closed the folder, tapped his fingers on it thoughtfully for a few moments, then returned to <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx1">
      Engineer Bob and Charlie spent many happy days together and talked of many things. Engineer Bob lived alone, and Charlie was the first real friend he’d had since his wife died, long ago, in New York.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Then one day, when Charlie and Engineer Bob returned to the roundhouse in St. Louis, they found a new diesel locomotive in Charlie’s berth. And what a diesel locomotive it was! 5,000 horsepower! Stainless steel couplers! Traction motors from the Utica Engine Works in Utica, New York! And sitting on top, behind the generator, were three bright yellow radiator cooling fans.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “What is this?” Engineer Bob asked in a worried voice, but Charlie only sang his song in his smallest, gruffest voice:

      <div class="atx">
        <div class="tx">
          <i class="calibre3">Don’t ask me silly questions,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
          <i class="calibre3">I won’t play silly games.</i><br class="calibre2"/>
          <i class="calibre3">I’m just a simple choo-choo train</i><br class="calibre2"/>
          <i class="calibre3">And I’ll always be the same.</i>
        </div>

        <div class="calibre2">
          <br class="calibre2"/>
        </div>

        <div class="tx">
          <i class="calibre3">I only want to race along</i><br class="calibre2"/>
          <i class="calibre3">Beneath the bright blue sky,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
          <i class="calibre3">And be a happy choo-choo train</i><br class="calibre2"/>
          <i class="calibre3">Until the day I die.</i>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Briggs, the Roundhouse Manager, came over.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That is a beautiful diesel locomotive.” said Engineer Bob, “but you will have to move it out of Charlie’s berth, Mr. Briggs. Charlie needs a lube job this very afternoon.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Charlie won’t be needing any more lube jobs, Engineer Bob,” said Mr. Briggs sadly. “This is his replacement—a brand-new Burlington Zephyr diesel loco. Once, Charlie was the best locomotive in the world, but now he is old and his boiler leaks. I am afraid the time has come for Charlie to retire.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nonsense!” Engineer Bob was mad! “Charlie is still full of zip and zowie! I will telegraph the head office of The Mid-World Railway Company! I will telegraph the President, Mr. Raymond Martin, myself! I know him, because he once gave me a Good Service Award, and afterwards Charlie and I took his little daughter for a ride. I let her pull the lanyard, and Charlie whistled his loudest for her!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I am sorry, Bob,” said Mr. Briggs, “but it was Mr. Martin himself who ordered the new diesel loco.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was true. And so Charlie the Choo-Choo was shunted off to a siding in the furthest corner of Mid-World’s St. Louis yard to rust in the weeds. Now the HONNNK! HONNNK! of the Burlington Zephyr was heard on the St. Louis to Topeka run, and Charlie’s blew no more. A family of mice nested in the seat where Engineer Bob once sat so proudly, watching the countryside speed past; a family of swallows nested in his smoke-stack. Charlie was lonely and very sad. He missed the steel tracks and bright blue skies and wide open spaces. Sometimes, late at night, he thought of these things and cried dark, oily tears. This rusted his fine Stratham headlight, but he didn’t care, because now the Stratham headlight was old, and it was always dark.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Martin, the President of The Mid-World Railway Company, wrote and offered to put Engineer Bob in the peak-seat of the new Burlington Zephyr. “It is a fine loco, Engineer Bob,” said Mr. Martin, “chock-full of zip and zowie, and you should be the one to pilot it! Of all the Engineers who work for Mid-World, you are the best. And my daughter Susannah has never forgotten that you let her pull old Charlie’s whistle.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But Engineer Bob said that if he couldn’t pilot Charlie, his days as a trainman were done. “I wouldn’t understand such a fine new diesel loco,” said Engineer Bob, “and it wouldn’t understand me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was given a job cleaning the engines in the St. Louis yards, and Engineer Bob became Wiper Bob. Sometimes the other engineers who drove the fine new diesels would laugh at him. “Look at that old fool!” they said. “He cannot understand that the world has moved on!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Sometimes, late at night, Engineer Bob would go to the far side of the rail yard, where Charlie the Choo-Choo stood on the rusty rails of the lonely siding which had become his home. Weeds had twined in his wheels; his headlight was rusty and dark. Engineer Bob always talked to Charlie, but Charlie replied less and less. Many nights he would not talk at all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One night, a terrible idea came into Engineer Bob’s head. “Charlie, are you dying?” he asked, and in his smallest, gruffest voice, Charlie replied:

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">Don’t ask me silly questions,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I won’t play silly games,</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I’m just a simple choo-choo train.</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">And I’ll always be the same.</i>
      </div>

      <div class="calibre2">
        <br class="calibre2"/>
      </div>

      <div class="tx">
        <i class="calibre3">Now that I can’t race along</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">Beneath the bright blue sky</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">I guess that I’ll just sit right here</i><br class="calibre2"/>
        <i class="calibre3">Until I finally die.</i>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked at the picture accompanying this not-exactly-unexpected turn of events for a long time. Rough drawing it might be, but it was still definitely a three-handkerchief job. Charlie looked old, beaten, and forgotten. Engineer Bob looked like he had lost his last friend . . . which, according to the story, he had. Jake could imagine children all over America blatting their heads off at this point, and it occurred to him that there were a <i class="calibre3">lot</i> of stories for kids with stuff like this in them, stuff that threw acid all over your emotions. Hansel and Gretel being turned out into the forest, Bambi’s mother getting scragged by a hunter, the death of Old Yeller. It was easy to hurt little kids, easy to make them cry, and this seemed to bring out a strangely sadistic streak in many story-tellers . . . including, it seemed, Beryl Evans.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But, Jake found, <i class="calibre3">he</i> was not saddened by Charlie’s relegation to the weedy wastelands at the outer edge of the Mid-World trainyards in St. Louis. Quite the opposite. <i class="calibre3">Good</i>, he thought. <i class="calibre3">That’s the place for him. That’s the place, because he’s dangerous</i>. <i class="calibre3">Let him rot there, and don’t trust that tear in his eye</i>—<i class="calibre3">they say crocodiles cry, too.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He read the rest rapidly. It had a happy ending, of course, although it was undoubtedly that moment of despair on the edge of the trainyards which children remembered long after the happy ending had slipped their minds.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Mr. Martin, the President of The Mid-World Railway Company, came to St. Louis to check on the operation. His plan was to ride the Burlington Zephyr to Topeka, where his daughter was giving her first piano recital, that very afternoon. Only the Zephyr wouldn’t start. There was water in the diesel fuel, it seemed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    (<i class="calibre3">Were you the one who watered the diesel, Engineer Bob?</i> Jake wondered. <i class="calibre3">I</i> bet it <i class="calibre3">was, you sly dog, you!</i>)
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    All the other trains were out on their runs! What to do?
  </div>

  <div class="atx">
    <div class="tx1">
      Someone tugged Mr. Martin’s arm. It was Wiper Bob, only he no longer looked like an engine-wiper. He had taken off his oil-stained dungarees and put on a clean pair of overalls. On his head was his old pillowtick engineer’s cap.
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Charlie’s is right over there, on that siding,” he said. “Charlie will make the run to Topeka, Mr. Martin. Charlie will get you there in time for your daughter’s piano recital.”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “That old steamer?” scoffed Mr. Briggs. “Charlie would still be fifty miles out of Topeka at sundown!”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Charlie can do it,” Engineer Bob insisted. “Without a train to pull, I know he can! I have been cleaning his engine and his boiler in my spare time, you see.”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “We’ll give it a try,” said Mr. Martin. “I would be sorry to miss Susannah’s first recital!”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Charlie was all ready to go; Engineer Bob had filled his tender with fresh coal, and the firebox was so hot its sides were red. He helped Mr. Martin up into the cab and backed Charlie off the rusty, forgotten siding and onto the main track for the first time in years. Then, as he engaged Forward First, he pulled on the lanyard and Charlie gave his old brave cry: <i class="calibre3">WHOOO</i>-<i class="calibre3">OOOOO!</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      All over St. Louis the children heard that cry, and ran out into their yards to watch the rusty old steam loco pass. “Look!” they cried. “It’s Charlie! Charlie the Choo-Choo is back! Hurrah!” They all waved, and as Charlie steamed out of town, gathering speed, he blew his own whistle, just as he had in the old days: <i class="calibre3">WHOOOO-OOOOOOO!</i>
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Clickety-clack</i> went Charlie’s wheels!
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Chuffa-chuffa</i> went the smoke from Charlie’s stack!
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      <i class="calibre3">Brump-brump</i> went the conveyor as it fed coal into the firebox!
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Talk about zip! Talk about zowie! Golly gee, gosh, and wowie! Charlie had never gone so fast before! The countryside went whizzing by in a blur! They passed the cars on Route 41 as if they were standing still!
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      “Hoptedoodle!” cried Mr. Martin, waving his hat in the air. “This is some locomotive, Bob! I don’t know why we ever retired it! How do you keep the coal-conveyor loaded at this speed?”
    </div>

    <div class="tx1">
      Engineer Bob only smiled, because he knew Charlie was <i class="calibre3">feeding himself.</i> And, beneath the <i class="calibre3">clickety-clack</i> and the <i class="calibre3">chuffa-chuffa</i> and the <i class="calibre3">brump-brump,</i> he could hear Charlie singing his old song in his low, gruff voice:

      <div class="atx">
        <div class="tx">
          <i class="calibre3">Don’t ask me silly questions,</i><br class="calibre2"/>

          <i class="calibre3">Until the day I die.</i>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Charlie got Mr. Martin to his daughter’s piano recital on time (of course), and Susannah was just tickled pink to see her old friend Charlie again (of course), and they all went back to St. Louis together with Susannah yanking hell out of the train-whistle the whole way. Mr. Martin got Charlie and Engineer Bob a gig pulling kids around the brand-new Mid-World Amusement Park and Fun Fair in California, and

    <div class="atx">
      <div class="tx">
        you will find them there to this day, pulling laughing children hither and thither in that world of lights and music and good, wholesome fun. Engineer Bob’s hair is white, and Charlie doesn’t talk as much as he once did, but both of them still have plenty of zip and zowie, and every now and then the children hear Charlie singing his old song in his soft, gruff voice.
      </div>

        THE END
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t ask me silly questions, I won’t play silly games,” Jake muttered, looking at the final picture. It showed Charlie the Choo-Choo pulling two bunting-decked passenger cars filled with happy children from the roller coaster to the Ferris wheel. Engineer Bob sat in the cab, pulling the whistle-cord and looking as happy as a pig in shit. Jake supposed Engineer Bob’s smile was supposed to convey supreme happiness, but to him it looked like the grin of a lunatic. Charlie and Engineer Bob <i class="calibre3">both</i> looked like lunatics . . . and the more Jake looked at the kids, the more he thought that their expressions looked like grimaces of terror. <i class="calibre3">Let us off this train,</i> those faces seemed to say. <i class="calibre3">Please, just let us off this train alive.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">And be a happy choo-choo train until the day I die.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake closed the book and looked at it thoughtfully. Then he opened it again and began to leaf through the pages, circling certain words and phrases that seemed to call out to him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">The Mid-World Railway Company . . . Engineer Bob . . . a small, gruff voice . . . WHOO-OOOO . . . the first real friend he’d had since his wife died, long ago, in New York . . . Mr. Martin . . . the world has moved on . . . Susannah . .</i> .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He put his pen down. <i class="calibre3">Why</i> did these words and phrases call to him? The one about New York seemed obvious enough, but what about the others? For that matter, why this <i class="calibre3">book?</i> That he had been meant to buy it was beyond question. If he hadn’t had the money in his pocket, he felt sure he would have simply grabbed it and bolted from the store. But <i class="calibre3">why?</i> He felt like a compass needle. The needle knows nothing about magnetic north; it only knows it must point in a certain direction, like it or not.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The only thing Jake knew for sure was that he was very, very tired, and if he didn’t crawl into bed soon, he was going to fall asleep at his desk. He took off his shirt, then gazed down at the front of <i class="calibre3">Charlie the Choo-Choo</i> again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    That smile. He just didn’t trust that smile.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Not a bit.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h23"/>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_22"><b class="calibre4">23</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    SLEEP DIDN’T COME AS soon as Jake had hoped. The voices began to argue again about whether he was alive or dead, and they kept him awake. At last he sat up in bed with his eyes closed and his fisted hands planted against his temples.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Quit!</i> he screamed at them. <i class="calibre3">Just quit! You were gone all day, be gone again!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I would if he’d just admit I’m dead, one of the voices said sulkily.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">I would if he’d just take a for God’s sake look around and admit I’m clearly alive,</i> the other snapped back.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He was going to scream right out loud. There was no way to hold it back; he could feel it coming up his throat like vomit. He opened his eyes, saw his pants lying over the seat of his desk chair, and an idea occurred to him. He got out of bed, went to the chair, and felt in the right front pocket of the pants.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The silver key was still there, and the moment his fingers closed around it, the voices ceased.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Tell him,</i> he thought, with no idea who the thought was for. <i class="calibre3">Tell him to grab the key. The key makes the voices go.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He went back to bed and was asleep with the key clasped loosely in his hand three minutes after his head hit the pillow.
