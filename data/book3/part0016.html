<body class="calibre">
  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man’s face contorted with rage; he threw the remainder of the water into Jake’s bruised, puffy face. “<i class="calibre3">Don’t you play it light with me!”</i> he shrieked. He stripped off the Seiko watch and shook it in front of Jake. “<i class="calibre3">When I asked you if this ran on a dipolar circuit, you said it didn’t! So don’t tell me you don’t know what I’m talking about when you already made it clear that you do!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But . . . but . . .” Jake couldn’t go on. His head was whirling with fear and confusion. He was aware, in some far-off fashion, that he was licking as much water as he could off his lips.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">There’s a thousand of those ever-fucking dipolar computers right under the ever-fucking city, maybe a HUNDRED thousand, and the only one that still works don’t do a thing except play Watch Me and run those drums! I want those computers! I want them working for ME!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man bolted forward on his throne, seized Jake, shook him back and forth, and then threw him to the floor. Jake struck one of the lamps, knocking it over, and the bulb blew with a hollow coughing sound. Tilly gave a little shriek and stepped backward, her eyes wide and frightened. Copperhead and Brandon looked at each other uneasily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock leaned forward, elbows on his thighs, and screamed into Jake’s face: “<i class="calibre3">I want them AND I MEAN TO HAVE THEM!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Silence fell in the room, broken only by the soft whoosh of warm air pouring from the ventilators. Then the twisted rage on the Tick-Tock Man’s face disappeared so suddenly it might never have existed at all. It was replaced by another charming smile. He leaned further forward and helped Jake to his feet.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sorry. I get thinking about the potential of this place and sometimes I get carried away. Please accept my apology, cully.” He picked up the overturned dipper and threw it at Tilly. “Fill this up, you useless bitch! What’s the matter with you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned his attention back to Jake, still smiling his TV game-show host smile.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right; you’ve had your little joke and I’ve had mine. Now tell me everything you know about dipolar computers and transitive circuits. Then you can have a drink.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake opened his mouth to say something—he had no idea what—and then, incredibly, Roland’s voice was in his mind, filling it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Distract them, Jake—and if there’s a button that opens the door, get close to it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man was watching him closely. “Something just came into your mind, didn’t it, cully? I always know. So don’t keep it a secret; tell your old friend Ticky.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake caught movement in the corner of his eye. Although he did not dare glance up at the ventilator panel—not with all the Tick-Tock Man’s notice bent upon him—he knew that Oy was back, peering down through the louvers.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Distract them . . . and suddenly Jake knew just how to do that.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I <i class="calibre3">did</i> think of something,” he said, “but it wasn’t about computers. It was about my old pal Gasher. And <i class="calibre3">his</i> old pal, Hoots.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Here! Here!” Gasher cried. “What are you talking about, boy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why don’t you tell Tick-Tock who <i class="calibre3">really</i> gave you the password, Gasher? Then <i class="calibre3">I</i> can tell Tick-Tock where you keep it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man’s puzzled gaze shifted from Jake to Gasher. “What’s he talking about?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nothin!” Gasher said, but he could not forbear a quick glance at Hoots. “He’s just runnin his gob, tryin to get off the hot-seat by puttin me on it, Ticky. I told you he was pert! Didn’t I say—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take a look in his scarf, why don’t you?” Jake asked. “He’s got a scrap of paper with the word written on it. I had to read it to him because he couldn’t even do that.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was no sudden rage on Tick-Tock’s part this time; his face darkened gradually instead, like a summer sky before a terrible thunderstorm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let me see your scarf, Gasher,” he said in a soft, thick voice. “Let your old pal sneak a peek.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He’s lyin, I tell you!” Gasher cried, putting his hands on his scarf and taking two steps backward toward the wall. Directly above him, Oy’s gold-ringed eyes gleamed. “All you got to do is look in his face to see lyin’s what a pert little cull like him does best!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man shifted his gaze to Hoots, who looked sick with fear. “What about it?” Tick-Tock asked in his soft, terrible voice. “What about it, Hooterman? I know you and Gasher was butt-buddies of old, and I know you’ve the brains of a hung goose, but surely not even you could be stupid enough to write down a password to the inner chamber . . . could you? <i class="calibre3">Could</i> you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I . . . I oney thought . . .” Hoots began.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Shut up!” Gasher shouted. He shot Jake a look of pure, sick hate. “I’ll kill you for this, dearie—see if I don’t.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take off your scarf, Gasher,” the Tick-Tock Man said. “I want a look inside it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake sidled a step closer to the podium with the buttons on it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No!” Gasher’s hands returned to the scarf and pressed against it as if it might fly away of its own accord. “Be damned if I will!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Brandon, grab him,” Tick-Tock said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Brandon lunged for Gasher. Gasher’s move wasn’t as quick as Tick-Tock’s had been, but it was quick enough; he bent, yanked a knife from the top of his boot, and buried it in Brandon’s arm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Oh, you barstard!</i>” Brandon shouted in surprise and pain as blood began to pour out of his arm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Lookit what you did</i>!” Tilly screamed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do I have to do <i class="calibre3">everything</i> around here myself?” Tick-Tock shouted, more exasperated than angry, it seemed, and rose to his feet. Gasher retreated from him, weaving the bloody knife back and forth in front of his face in mystic patterns. He kept his other hand planted firmly on top of his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Draw back,” he panted. “I loves you like a brother, Ticky, but if you don’t draw back, I’ll hide this blade in your guts—so I will.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">You?</i> Not likely,” the Tick-Tock Man said with a laugh. He removed his own knife from its scabbard and held it delicately by the bone hilt. All eyes were on the two of them. Jake took two quick steps to the podium with its little cluster of buttons and reached for the one he thought the Tick-Tock man had pushed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher was backing along the curved wall, the tubes of light painting his mandrus-riddled face in a succession of sick colors: bile-green, fever-red, jaundice-yellow. Now it was the Tick-Tock Man standing below the ventilator grille where Oy was watching.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Put it down, Gasher,” Tick-Tock said in a reasonable tone of voice. “You brought the boy as I asked; if anyone else gets pricked over this, it’ll be Hoots, not you. Just show me—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake saw Oy crouching to spring and understood two things: what the bumbler meant to do and who had put him up to it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Oy, no!”</i> he screamed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    All of them turned to look at him. At that moment Oy leaped, hitting the flimsy ventilator grille and knocking it free. The Tick-Tock Man wheeled toward the sound, and Oy fell onto his upturned face, biting and slashing.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h32"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_0"><b class="calibre4">32</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND HEARD IT FAINTLY even through the twin doors—<i class="calibre3">Oy</i>, <i class="calibre3">no!—</i>and his heart sank. He waited for the valve-wheel to turn, but it did not. He closed his eyes and sent with all his might: <i class="calibre3">The door, Jake! Open the door!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He sensed no response, and the pictures were gone. His communication line with Jake, flimsy to begin with, had now been severed.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h33"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_1"><b class="calibre4">33</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE TICK-TOCK MAN blundered backward, cursing and screaming and grabbing at the writhing, biting, digging thing on his face. He felt Oy’s claws punch into his left eye, popping it, and a horrible red pain sank into his head like a flaming torch thrown down a deep well. At that point, rage overwhelmed pain. He seized Oy, tore him off his face, and held him over his head, meaning to twist him like a rag.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“No!”</i> Jake wailed. He forgot about the button which unlocked the doors and seized the gun hanging from the back of the chair.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tilly shrieked. The others scattered. Jake levelled the old German machine-gun at the Tick-Tock Man. Oy, upside down in those huge, strong hands and bent almost to the snapping point, writhed madly and slashed his teeth into the air. He shrieked in agony—a horribly human sound.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Leave him alone, you bastard!</i>” Jake screamed, and pressed the trigger.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had enough presence of mind left to aim low. The roar of the Schmeisser .40 was ear-splitting in the enclosed space, although it fired only five or six rounds. One of the lighted tubes popped in a burst of cold orange fire. A hole appeared an inch above the left knee of the Tick-Tock Man’s tight-fitting trousers, and a dark red stain began to spread at once. Tick-Tock’s mouth opened in a shocked O of surprise, an expression which said more clearly than words could have done that, for all his intelligence, Tick-Tock had expected to live a long, happy life where he shot people but was never shot himself. Shot <i class="calibre3">at,</i> perhaps, but actually hit? That surprised expression said that just wasn’t supposed to be in the cards.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Welcome to the real world, you fuck</i>, Jake thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Tick-Tock dropped Oy to the iron grillework floor to grab at his wounded leg. Copperhead lunged at Jake, got an arm around his throat, and then Oy was on him, barking shrilly and chewing at Copperhead’s ankle through the black silk pants. Copperhead screamed and danced away, shaking Oy back and forth at the end of his leg. Oy clung like a limpet. Jake turned to see the Tick-Tock Man crawling toward him. He had retrieved his knife and the blade was now clamped between his teeth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Goodbye, Ticky,” Jake said, and pressed the Schmeisser’s trigger again. Nothing happened. Jake didn’t know if it was empty or jammed, and this was hardly the time to speculate. He took two steps backward before finding further retreat blocked by the big chair which had served the Tick-Tock Man as a throne. Before he could slip around, putting the chair between them, Tick-Tock had grabbed his ankle. His other hand went to the hilt of his knife. The ruins of his left eye lay on his cheek like a glob of mint jelly; the right eye glared up at Jake with insane hatred.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake tried to pull away from the clutching hand and went sprawling on the Tick-Tock Man’s throne. His eye fell on a pocket which had been sewn into the right-hand arm-rest. Jutting from the elasticized top was the cracked pearl handle of a revolver.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, cully, how you’ll suffer!” the Tick-Tock Man whispered ecstatically. The O of surprise had been replaced by a wide, trembling grin. “Oh how you’ll suffer! And how happy I’ll be to . . . <i class="calibre3">What—?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The grin slackened and the surprised O began to reappear as Jake pointed the cheesy nickel-plated revolver at him and thumbed back the hammer. The grip on Jake’s ankle tightened until it seemed to him that the bones there must snap.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You <i class="calibre3">dasn’t</i>!” Tick-Tock said in a screamy whisper.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes I <i class="calibre3">do</i>,” Jake said grimly, and pulled the trigger of the Tick-Tock Man’s runout gun. There was a flat crack, much less dramatic than the Schmeisser’s Teutonic roar. A small black hole appeared high up on the right side of Tick-Tock’s forehead. The Tick-Tock Man went on staring up at Jake, disbelief in his remaining eye.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake tried to make himself shoot him again and couldn’t do it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Suddenly a flap of the Tick-Tock Man’s scalp peeled away like old wallpaper and dropped on his right cheek. Roland would have known what this meant; Jake, however, was now almost beyond coherent thought. A dark, panicky horror was spinning across his mind like a tornado funnel. He cringed back in the big chair as the hand on his ankle fell away and the Tick-Tock Man collapsed forward on his face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The door. He had to open the door and let the gunslinger in.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Focusing on that and nothing but, Jake let the pearl-handled revolver clatter to the iron grating and pushed himself out of the chair. He was reaching again for the button he thought he had seen Tick-Tock push when a pair of hands settled around his throat and dragged him backward, away from the podium.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I said I’d kill you for it, my narsty little pal,” a voice whispered in his ear, “and the Gasherman always keeps his promises.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake flailed behind him with both hands and found nothing but thin air. Gasher’s fingers sank into his throat, choking relentlessly. The world started to turn gray in front of his eyes. Gray quickly deepened to purple, and purple to black.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h34"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_2"><b class="calibre4">34</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    A PUMP STARTED UP, and the valve-wheel in the center of the hatch spun rapidly. <i class="calibre3">Gods be thanked!</i> Roland thought. He seized the wheel with his right hand almost before it had stopped moving and yanked it open. The other door was ajar; from beyond it came the sounds of men fighting and Oy’s bark, now shrill with pain and fury.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland kicked the door open with his boot and saw Gasher throttling Jake. Oy had left Copperhead and was now trying to make Gasher let go of Jake, but Gasher’s boot was doing double duty: protecting its owner from the bumbler’s teeth, and protecting Oy from the virulent infection which ran in Gasher’s blood. Brandon stabbed Oy in the flank again in an effort to make him stop worrying Gasher’s ankle, but Oy paid no heed. Jake hung from his captor’s dirty hands like a puppet whose strings have been cut. His face was bluish-white, his swollen lips a delicate shade of lavender.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Gasher looked up. “<i class="calibre3">You,</i>” he snarled.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Me,” Roland agreed. He fired once and the left side of Gasher’s head disintegrated. The man went flying backward, bloodstained yellow scarf unravelling, and landed on top of the Tick-Tock Man. His feet drummed spastically on the iron grillework for a moment and then fell still.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger shot Brandon twice, fanning the hammer of his revolver with the flat of his right hand. Brandon, who had been bent over Oy for another stroke, spun around, struck the wall, and slid slowly down it, clutching at one of the tubes. Green swamp-light spilled out from between his loosening fingers,
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy limped to where Jake lay and began licking his pale, still face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Copperhead and Hoots had seen enough. They ran side by side for the small door through which Tilly had gone to get the dipper of water. It was the wrong time for chivalry; Roland shot them both in the back. He would have to move fast now, very fast indeed, and he would not risk being waylaid by these two if they should chance to rediscover their guts.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A cluster of bright orange lights came on at the top of the capsule-shaped enclosure, and an alarm began to go off: in broad, hoarse blats that battered the walls. After a moment or two, the emergency lights began to pulse in sync with the alarm.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h35"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_3"><b class="calibre4">35</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE WAS RETURNING TO Susannah when the alarm began to wail. He yelled in surprise and raised the Ruger, pointing it at nothing. “<i class="calibre3">What’s happening</i>?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah shook her head—she had no idea. The alarm was scary, but that was only part of the problem; it was also loud enough to be physically painful. Those amplified jags of sound made Eddie think of a tractor-trailer horn raised to the tenth power.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    At that moment, the orange arc-sodiums began to pulse. When he reached Susannah’s chair, Eddie saw that the COMMAND and ENTER buttons were also pulsing in bright red beats. They looked like winking eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Blaine, what’s happening?” he shouted. He looked around but saw only wildly jumping shadows. “Are you doing this?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine’s only response was laughter—terrible mechanical laughter that made Eddie think of the clockwork clown that had stood outside the House of Horrors at Coney Island when he was a little kid.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Blaine, stop it!</i>” Susannah shrieked. “<i class="calibre3">How can we think of an answer to your riddle with that air-raid siren going off?</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The laughter stopped as suddenly as it began, but Blaine made no reply. Or perhaps he did; from beyond the bars that separated them from the platform, huge engines powered by frictionless slo-trans turbines awoke at the command of the dipolar computers the Tick-Tock Man had so lusted after. For the first time in a decade, Blaine the Mono was awake and cycling up toward running speed.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h36"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_4"><b class="calibre4">36</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE ALARM, WHICH HAD indeed been built to warn Lud’s long-dead residents of an impending air attack (and which had not even been tested in almost a thousand years), blanketed the city with sound. All the lights which still operated came on and began to pulse in sync. Pubes above the streets and Grays below them were alike convinced that the end they had always feared was finally upon them. The Grays suspected some cataclysmic mechanical breakdown was occurring. The Pubes, who had always believed that the ghosts lurking in the machines below the city would some day rise up to take their long-delayed vengeance on the still living, were probably closer to the actual truth of what was happening.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Certainly there had been an intelligence left in the ancient computers below the city, a single living organism which had long ago ceased to exist sanely under conditions that, within its merciless dipolar circuits, could only be absolute reality. It had held its increasingly alien logic within its banks of memory for eight hundred years and might have held them so for eight hundred more, if not for the arrival of Roland and his friends; yet this <i class="calibre3">mens non corpus</i> had brooded and grown ever more insane with each passing year; even in its increasing periods of sleep it could be said to dream, and these dreams grew steadily more abnormal as the world moved on. Now, although the unthinkable machinery which maintained the Beams had weakened, this insane and inhuman intelligence had awakened in the rooms of ruin and had begun once more, although as bodiless as any ghost, to stumble through the halls of the dead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    In other words, Blaine the Mono was preparing to get out of Dodge.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_5"><b class="calibre4">37</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    ROLAND HEARD A FOOTSTEP behind him as he knelt by Jake and turned, raising his gun. Tilly, her dough-colored face a mask of confusion and superstitious fear, raised her hands and shrieked: “<i class="calibre3">Don’t kill me, sai! Please! Don’t kill me!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Run, then,” Roland said curtly, and as Tilly began to move, he struck her calf with the barrel of his revolver. “Not that way—through the door I came in. And if you ever see me again, I’ll be the last thing you ever see. Now <i class="calibre3">go</i>!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She disappeared into the leaping, circling shadows.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland dropped his head to Jake’s chest, slamming his palm against his other ear to deaden the pulse of the alarm. He heard the boy’s heartbeat, slow but strong. He slipped his arms around the boy, and as he did, Jakes’s eyes fluttered open. “You didn’t let me fall this time.” His voice was no more than a hoarse whisper.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No. Not this time, and not ever again. Don’t try your voice.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Where’s Oy?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy!” the bumbler barked. <i class="calibre3">“Oy!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Brandon had slashed Oy several times, but none of the wounds seemed mortal or even serious. It was clear that he was in some pain, but it was equally clear he was transported with joy. He regarded Jake with sparkling eyes, his pink tongue lolling out. “Ake, Ake, <i class="calibre3">Ake!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake burst into tears and reached for him; Oy limped into the circle of his arms and allowed himself to be hugged for a moment.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland got up and looked around. His gaze fixed on the door on the far side of the room. The two men he’d backshot had been heading in that direction, and the woman had also wanted to go that way. The gunslinger went toward the door with Jake in his arms and Oy at his heel. He kicked one of the dead Grays aside, and ducked through. The room beyond was a kitchen. It managed to look like a hog-wallow in spite of the built-in appliances and the stainless steel walls; the Grays were apparently not much interested in housekeeping.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Drink,” Jake whispered. “Please . . . so thirsty.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland felt a queer doubling, as if time had folded backward on itself. He remembered lurching out of the desert, crazy with the heat and the emptiness. He remembered passing out in the stable of the way station, half-dead from thirst, and waking at the taste of cool water trickling down his throat. The boy had taken off his shirt, soaked it under the flow from the pump, and given him to drink. Now it was his turn to do for Jake what Jake had already done for him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland glanced around and saw a sink. He went over to it and turned on the faucet. Cold, clear water rushed out. Over them, around them, under them, the alarm roared on and on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Can you stand?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded. “I think so.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland set the boy on his feet, ready to catch him if he looked too wobbly, but Jake hung onto the sink, then ducked his head beneath the flowing water. Roland picked Oy up and looked at his wounds. They were already clotting. <i class="calibre3">You got off very lucky, my furry friend,</i> Roland thought, then reached past Jake to cup a palmful of water for the animal. Oy drank it eagerly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake drew back from the faucet with his hair plastered to the sides of his face. His skin was still too pale and the signs that he had been badly beaten were clearly visible, but he looked better than he had when Roland had first bent over him. For one terrible moment, the gunslinger had been positive Jake was dead.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He found himself wishing he could go back and kill Gasher again, and that led him to another thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What about the one Gasher called the Tick-Tock Man? Did you see him, Jake?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. Oy ambushed him. Tore up his face. Then I shot him.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Dead?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake’s lips began to tremble. He pressed them firmly together. “Yes. In his . . .” He tapped his forehead high above his right eyebrow. “I was l-l- . . . I was lucky.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland looked at him appraisingly, then slowly shook his head. “You know, I doubt that. But never mind now. Come on.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Where are we going?” Jake’s voice was still little more than a husky murmur, and he kept looking past Roland’s shoulder toward the room where he had almost died.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland pointed across the kitchen. Beyond another hatchway, the corridor continued. “That’ll do for a start.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “GUNSLINGER,” a voice boomed from everywhere.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland wheeled around, one arm cradling Oy and the other around Jake’s shoulders, but there was no one to see.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who speaks to me?” he shouted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “NAME YOURSELF, GUNSLINGER.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland of Gilead, son of Steven. Who speaks to me?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “GILEAD IS NO MORE,” the voice mused, ignoring the question.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland looked up and saw patterns of concentric rings in the ceiling. The voice was coming from those.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “NO GUNSLINGER HAS WALKED IN-WORLD OR MID-WORLD FOR ALMOST THREE HUNDRED YEARS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I and my friends are the last.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake took Oy from Roland. The bumbler at once began to lick the boy’s swollen face; his gold-ringed eyes were full of adoration and happiness.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s Blaine,” Jake whispered to Roland. “Isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. Of course it was—but he had an idea that there was a great deal more to Blaine than just a monorail train.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “BOY! ARE YOU JAKE OF NEW YORK?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake pressed closer to Roland and looked up at the speakers. “Yes,” he said. “That’s me. Jake of New York. Uh . . . son of Elmer.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “DO YOU STILL HAVE THE BOOK OF RIDDLES? THE ONE OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN TOLD?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake reached over his shoulder, and an expression of dismayed recollection filled his face as his fingers touched nothing but his own back. When he looked at Roland again, the gunslinger was holding his pack out toward him, and although the man’s narrow, finely carved face was as expressionless as ever, Jake sensed the ghost of a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’ll have to fix the straps,” Roland said as Jake took the pack. “I made them longer.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But <i class="calibre3">Riddle-De-Dum!—?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “Both books are still in there.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “WHAT YOU GOT, LITTLE PILGRIM?” the voice inquired in a leisurely drawl.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Cripes!” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It can see us as well as hear us,</i> Roland thought, and a moment later he spotted a small glass eye in one corner, far above a man’s normal line of sight. He felt a chill slip over his skin, and knew from both the troubled look on Jake’s face and the way the boy’s arms had tightened around Oy that he wasn’t alone in his unease. That voice belonged to a machine, an incredibly <i class="calibre3">smart</i> machine, a <i class="calibre3">playful</i> machine, but there was something very wrong with it, all the same.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The book,” Jake said. “I’ve got the riddle book.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “GOOD.” There was an almost human satisfaction in the voice. “REALLY EXCELLENT.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A scruffy, bearded fellow suddenly appeared in the doorway on the far side of the kitchen. A bloodstained, dirt-streaked yellow scarf flapped from the newcomer’s upper arm. “Fires in the walls!” he screamed. In his panic, he seemed not to realize that Roland and Jake were not part of his miserable subterranean <i class="calibre3">ka-tet.</i> “Smoke on the lower levels! People killin theirselves! Somepin’s gone wrong! Hell, <i class="calibre3">everythin’s</i> gone wrong! We gotta—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The door of the oven suddenly dropped open like an unhinged jaw. A thick beam of blue-white fire shot out and engulfed the scruffy man’s head. He was driven backward with his clothes in flames and his skin boiling on his face.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake stared up at Roland, stunned and horrified. Roland put an arm about the boy’s shoulders.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “HE INTERRUPTED ME,” the voice said. “THAT WAS RUDE, WASN’T IT?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said calmly. “Extremely rude.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “SUSANNAH OF NEW YORK SAYS YOU HAVE A GREAT MANY RIDDLES BY HEART, ROLAND OF GILEAD. IS THIS TRUE?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was an explosion in one of the rooms opening off this arm of the corridor; the floor shuddered beneath their feet and voices screamed in a jagged chorus. The pulsing lights and the endless, blatting siren faded momentarily, then came back strong. A little skein of bitter, acrid smoke drifted from the ventilators. Oy got a whiff and sneezed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “TELL ME ONE OF YOUR RIDDLES, GUNSLINGER,” the voice invited. It was serene and untroubled, as if they were all sitting together in a peaceful village square somewhere instead of beneath a city that seemed on the verge of ripping itself apart.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland thought for a moment, and what came to mind was Cuthbert’s favorite riddle. “All right, Blaine,” he said, “I will. What’s better than all the gods and worse than Old Man Splitfoot? Dead people eat it always; live people who eat it die slow.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a long pause. Jake put his face in Oy’s fur to try to get away from the stink of the roasted Gray.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Be careful, gunslinger.”</i> The voice was as small as a cool puff of breeze on summer’s hottest day. The voice of the machine had come from all the speakers, but this one came only from the speaker directly overhead. “<i class="calibre3">Be careful, Jake of New York. Remember that these are The Drawers. Go slow and be very careful.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked at the gunslinger with widening eyes. Roland gave his head a small, faint shake and raised one finger. He looked as if he was scratching the side of his nose, but that finger also lay across his lips, and Jake had an idea Roland was actually telling him to keep his mouth shut.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A CLEVER RIDDLE,” Blaine said at last. There seemed to be real admiration in its voice. “THE ANSWER IS NOTHING, IS IT NOT?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s right,” Roland said. “You’re pretty clever yourself, Blaine.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When the voice spoke again, Roland heard what Eddie had heard already: a deep and ungovernable greed. “ASK ME ANOTHER.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland drew a deep breath. “Not just now.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I HOPE YOU ARE NOT REFUSING ME, ROLAND, SON OF STEVEN, FOR THAT IS ALSO RUDE. <i class="calibre3">EXTREMELY</i> RUDE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take us to our friends and help us get out of Lud,” Roland said. “Then there may be time for riddling.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I COULD KILL YOU WHERE YOU STAND,” the voice said, and now it was as cold as winter’s darkest day.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said. “I’m sure you could. But the riddles would die with us.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I COULD TAKE THE BOY’S BOOK.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thieving is ruder than either refusal or interruption,” Roland remarked. He spoke as if merely passing the time of day, but the remaining fingers of his right hand were tight on Jake’s shoulder.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Besides,” Jake said, looking up at the speaker in the ceiling, “the answers aren’t in the book. Those pages were torn out.” In a flash of inspiration, he tapped his temple. “They’re up here, though.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YOU FELLOWS WANT TO REMEMBER THAT NOBODY LOVES A SMARTASS,” Blaine said. There was another explosion, this one louder and closer. One of the ventilator grilles blew off and shot across the kitchen like a projectile. A moment later two men and a woman emerged through the door which led to the rest of the Grays’ warren. The gunslinger levelled his revolver at them, then lowered it as they stumbled across the kitchen and into the silo beyond without so much as a look at Roland and Jake. To Roland they looked like animals fleeing before a forest fire.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A stainless steel panel in the ceiling slid open, revealing a square of darkness. Something silvery flashed within it, and a few moments later a steel sphere, perhaps a foot in diameter, dropped from the hole and hung in the air of the kitchen.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “FOLLOW,” Blaine said flatly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Will it take us to Eddie and Susannah?” Jake asked hopefully.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine replied only with silence . . . but when the sphere began floating down the corridor, Roland and Jake followed it.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h38"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_6"><b class="calibre4">38</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    JAKE HAD NO CLEAR memory of the time which followed, and that was probably merciful. He had left his world over a year before nine hundred people would commit suicide together in a small South American country called Guyana, but he knew about the periodic death-rushes of the lemmings, and what was happening in the disintegrating undercity of the Grays was like that.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There were explosions, some on their level but most far below them; acrid smoke occasionally drifted from the ventilator grilles, but most of the air-purifiers were still working and they whipped the worst of it away before it could gather in choking clouds. They saw no fires. Yet the Grays were reacting as if the time of the apocalypse had come. Most only fled, their faces blank O’s of panic, but many had committed suicide in the halls and interconnected rooms through which the steel sphere led Roland and Jake. Some had shot themselves; many more had slashed their throats or wrists; a few appeared to have swallowed poison. On all the faces of the dead was the same expression of overmastering terror. Jake could only vaguely understand what had driven them to this. Roland had a better idea of what had happened to them—to their <i class="calibre3">minds</i>—when the long-dead city first came to life around them and then seemed to commence tearing itself apart. And it was Roland who understood that Blaine was doing it on purpose. That Blaine was driving them to it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They ducked around a man hanging from an overhead heating-duct and pounded down a flight of steel stairs behind the floating steel ball.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Jake!” Roland shouted. “You never let me in at all, did you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake shook his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I didn’t think so. It was Blaine.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They reached the bottom of the stairs and hurried along a narrow corridor toward a hatch with the words ABSOLUTELY NO ADMITTANCE printed on it in the spiked letters of the High Speech.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Is</i> it Blaine?” Jake asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes—that’s as good a name as any.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What about the other v—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hush!” Roland said grimly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The steel ball paused in front of the hatchway. The wheel spun and the hatch popped ajar. Roland pulled it open, and they stepped into a huge underground room which stretched away in three directions as far as they could see. It was filled with seemingly endless aisles of control panels and electronic equipment. Most of the panels were still dark and dead, but as Jake and Roland stood inside the door, looking about with wide eyes, they could see pilot-lights coming on and hear machinery cycling up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The Tick-Tock Man said there were thousands of computers,” Jake said. “I guess he was right. My God, look!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland did not understand the word Jake had used and so said nothing. He only watched as row after row of panels lit up. A cloud of sparks and a momentary tongue of green fire jumped from one of the consoles as some ancient piece of equipment malfunctioned.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Most of the machinery, however, appeared to be up and running just fine. Needles which hadn’t moved in centuries suddenly jumped into the green. Huge aluminum cylinders spun, spilling data stored on silicon chips into memory banks which were once more wide awake and ready for input. Digital displays, indicating everything from the mean aquifer water-pressure in the West River Barony to available power amperage in the hibernating Send Basin Nuclear Plant, lit up in brilliant dot-matrices of red and green. Overhead, banks of hanging globes began to flash on, radiating outward in spokes of light. And from below, above, and around them—from everywhere—came the deep bass hum of generators and slo-trans engines awakening from their long sleep.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake had begun to flag badly. Roland swept him into his arms again and chased the steel ball past machines at whose function and intent he could not even guess. Oy ran at his heels. The ball banked left, and the aisle in which they now found themselves ran between banks of TV monitors, thousands of them, stacked in rows like a child’s building blocks.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">My dad would love it,</i> Jake thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Some sections of this vast video arcade were still dark, but many of the screens were on. They showed a city in chaos, both above and below. Clumps of Pubes surged pointlessly through the streets, eyes wide, mouths moving soundlessly. Many were leaping from the tall buildings. Jake observed with horror that hundreds more had congregated at the Send Bridge and were throwing themselves into the river. Other screens showed large, cot-filled rooms like dormitories. Some of these rooms were on fire, but the panic-stricken Grays seemed to be setting the fires themselves—torching their own mattresses and furniture for God alone knew what reason.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    One screen showed a barrel-chested giant tossing men and women into what looked like a blood-spattered stamping press. This was bad enough, but there was something worse: the victims were standing in an unguarded line, docilely waiting their turns. The executioner, his yellow scarf pulled tight over his skull and the knotted ends swinging below his ears like pigtails, seized an old woman and held her up, waiting patiently for the stainless steel block of metal to clear the killing floor so he could toss her in. The old woman did not struggle; seemed, in fact, to be <i class="calibre3">smiling.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “IN THE ROOMS THE PEOPLE COME AND GO,” Blaine said, “BUT I DON’T THINK ANY OF THEM ARE TALKING OF MICHELANGELO.” He suddenly laughed—strange, tittery laughter that sounded like rats scampering over broken glass. The sound sent chills chasing up Jake’s neck. He wanted nothing at all to do with an intelligence that laughed like that . . . but what choice did they have?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned his gaze helplessly back to the monitors . . . and Roland at once turned his head away. He did this gently but firmly. “There’s nothing there you need to look at, Jake,” he said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But why are they doing it?” Jake asked. He had eaten nothing all day, but he still felt like vomiting. <i class="calibre3">“Why?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because they’re frightened, and Blaine is feeding their fear. But mostly, I think, because they’ve lived too long in the graveyard of their grandfathers and they’re tired of it. And before you pity them, remember how happy they would have been to take you along with them into the clearing where the path ends.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The steel ball zipped around another corner, leaving the TV screens and electronic monitoring equipment behind. Ahead, a wide ribbon of some synthetic stuff was set into the floor. It gleamed like fresh tar between two narrow strips of chrome steel that dwindled to a point on what was not the far side of this room, but its horizon.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The ball bounced impatiently above the dark strip, and suddenly the belt—for that was what it was—swept into silent motion, trundling along between its steel facings at jogging speed. The ball made small arcs in the air, urging them to climb on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland trotted beside the moving strip until he was roughly matching its speed, then did just that. He set Jake down and the three of them—gunslinger, boy, and golden-eyed bumbler—were carried rapidly across this shadowy underground plain where the ancient machines were awakening. The moving strip carried them into an area of what looked like filing cabinets—row after endless row of them. They were dark . . . but not dead. A low, sleepy humming sound came from within them, and Jake could see hairline cracks of bright yellow light shining between the steel panels.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He suddenly found himself thinking of the Tick-Tock Man.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">There’s maybe a hundred thousand of those ever-fucking dipolar computers under the ever-fucking city! I want those computers!</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Well</i>, Jake thought, <i class="calibre3">they’re waking up, so I guess you’re getting what you wanted, Ticky . . . but if you were here, I’m not sure you’d still want it.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then he remembered Tick-Tock’s great-grandfather, who’d been brave enough to climb into an airplane from another world and take it into the sky. With that kind of blood running in his veins, Jake supposed, Tick-Tock, far from being frightened to the point of suicide, would have been delighted by this turn of events ... and the more people who killed themselves in terror, the happier he would have been.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Too late</i> now, <i class="calibre3">Ticky</i>, he thought. <i class="calibre3">Thank God</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland spoke in a soft, wondering voice. “All these boxes . . . I think we’re riding through the mind of the thing that calls itself Blaine, Jake. <i class="calibre3">I think we’re riding through its mind.”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded, and found himself thinking of his Final Essay. “Blaine the Brain is a hell of a pain.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked closely at Roland. “Are we going to come out where I think we’re going to come out?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said. “If we’re still following the Path of the Beam, we’ll come out in the Cradle.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded. “Roland?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thanks for coming after me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded and put an arm around Jake’s shoulders.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Far ahead of them, huge motors rumbled to life. A moment later a heavy grinding sound began and new light—the harsh glow of orange arc-sodiums—flooded down on them. Jake could now see the place where the moving belt stopped. Beyond it was a steep, narrow escalator, leading up into that orange light.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h39"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_7"><b class="calibre4">39</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    EDDIE AND SUSANNAH HEARD heavy motors start up almost directly beneath them. A moment later, a wide strip of the marble floor began to pull slowly back, revealing a long lighted slot below. The floor was disappearing in their direction. Eddie seized the handles of Susannah’s chair and rolled it rapidly backward along the steel barrier between the monorail platform and the rest of the Cradle. There were several pillars along the course of the growing rectangle of light, and Eddie waited for them to tumble into the hole as the floor upon which they stood disappeared from beneath their bases. It didn’t happen. The pillars went on serenely standing, seeming to float on nothing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I see an escalator!” Susannah shouted over the endless, pulsing alarm. She was leaning forward, peering into the hole.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Uh-huh,” Eddie shouted back. “We got the el station up here, so it must be notions, perfume, and ladies’ lingerie down there.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“What?”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Never mind!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Eddie!”</i> Susannah screamed. Delighted surprise burst over her face like a Fourth of July firework. She leaned even further forward, pointing, and Eddie had to grab her to keep her from tumbling out of the chair. <i class="calibre3">“It’s Roland! It’s both of them!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a shuddery thump as the slot in the floor opened to its maximum length and stopped. The motors which had driven it along its hidden tracks cut out in a long, dying whine. Eddie ran to the edge of the hole and saw Roland riding on one of the escalator steps. Jake—white-faced, bruised, bloody, but clearly Jake and clearly alive—was standing next to him and leaning on the gunslinger’s shoulder. And sitting on the step right behind them, looking up with his bright eyes, was Oy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Roland! Jake!”</i> Eddie shouted. He leaped up, waving his hands over his head, and came down dancing on the edge of the slot. If he had been wearing a hat, he would have thrown it in the air.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They looked up and waved. Jake was grinning, Eddie saw, and even old long tall and ugly looked as if he might break down and crack a smile before long. Wonders, Eddie thought, would never cease. His heart suddenly felt too big for his chest and he danced faster, waving his arms and whooping, afraid that if he didn’t keep moving, his joy and relief might actually cause him to burst. Until this moment he had not realized how positive his heart had become that they would never see Roland and Jake again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Hey, guys! All RIGHT! Far fucking out! Get your asses up here!</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie, help me!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He turned. Susannah was trying to struggle out of her chair, but a fold of the deerskin trousers she was wearing had gotten caught in the brake mechanism. She was laughing and weeping at the same time, her dark eyes blazing with happiness. Eddie lifted her from the chair so violently that it crashed over on its side. He danced her around in a circle. She clung to his neck with one hand and waved strenuously with the other.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland! Jake! Get on up here! Shuck your butts, you hear me?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    When they reached the top, Eddie embraced Roland, pounding him on the back while Susannah covered Jake’s upturned, laughing face with kisses. Oy ran around in tight figure eights, barking shrilly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sugar!” Susannah said. “You all right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Jake said. He was still grinning, but tears stood in his eyes. “And glad to be here. You’ll never know how glad.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I can guess, sugar. You c’n bet on <i class="calibre3">that</i>.” She turned to look at Roland. “What’d they do to him? His face look like somebody run over it with a bulldozer.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That was mostly Gasher,” Roland said. “He won’t be bothering Jake again. Or anyone else.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What about you, big boy? You all right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded, looking about. “So this is the Cradle.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Eddie said. He was peering into the slot. “What’s down there?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Machines and madness.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Loquacious as ever, I see.” Eddie looked at Roland, smiling. “Do you know how happy I am to see you, man? Do you have any idea?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes—I think I do.” Roland smiled then, thinking of how people changed. There had been a time, and not so long ago, when Eddie had been on the edge of cutting his throat with the gunslinger’s own knife.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The engines below them started up again. The escalator came to a stop. The slot in the floor began to slide closed once more. Jake went to Susannah’s overturned chair, and as he was righting it, he caught sight of the smooth pink shape beyond the iron bars. His breath stopped, and the dream he had had after leaving River Crossing returned full force: the vast pink bullet shape slicing across the empty lands of western Missouri toward him and Oy. Two big triangular windows glittering high up in the blank face of that oncoming monster, windows like eyes . . . and now his dream was becoming reality, just as he had known it eventually would.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">It’s just an awful choo-choo train, and its name is Blaine the Pain</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie walked over and slung an arm around Jake’s shoulders. “Well, there it is, champ—just as advertised. What do you think of it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not too much, actually.” This was an understatement of colossal size, but Jake was too drained to do any better.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Me, either,” Eddie said. “It talks. And it likes riddles.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland had Susannah planted on one hip, and together they were examining the control box with its diamond-pattern of raised number-pads. Jake and Eddie joined them. Eddie found he had to keep looking down at Jake in order to verify that it wasn’t just his imagination or wishful thinking; the boy was really here.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What now?” he asked Roland.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland slipped his finger lightly over the numbered buttons which made up the diamond shape and shook his head. He didn’t know.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because I think the mono’s engines are cycling faster,” Eddie said. “I mean, it’s hard to tell for sure with that alarm blatting, but I think it is . . . and it’s a robot, after all. What if it, like, leaves without us?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Blaine!” Susannah shouted. “Blaine, are you—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “LISTEN CLOSELY, MY FRIENDS,” Blaine’s voice boomed. “THERE ARE LARGE STOCKPILES OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WARFARE CANNISTERS UNDER THE CITY. I HAVE STARTED A SEQUENCE WHICH WILL CAUSE AN EXPLOSION AND RELEASE THIS GAS. THIS EXPLOSION WILL OCCUR IN TWELVE MINUTES.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The voice fell silent for a moment, and then the voice of Little Blaine, almost buried by the steady, pulsing whoop of the alarm, came to them: “. . . <i class="calibre3">I was afraid of something like this . . . you must hurry . .</i> .”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie ignored Little Blaine, who wasn’t telling him a damned thing he didn’t already know. Of <i class="calibre3">course,</i> they had to hurry, but that fact was running a distant second at the moment. Something much larger occupied most of his mind. “<i class="calibre3">Why?</i>” he asked. “Why in God’s name would you do that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I SHOULD THINK IT OBVIOUS. I CAN’T NUKE THE CITY WITHOUT DESTROYING MYSELF, AS WELL. AND HOW COULD I TAKE YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IF I WERE DESTROYED?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But there are still thousands of people in the city,” Eddie said. “You’ll <i class="calibre3">kill</i> them.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES,” Blaine said calmly. “SEE YOU LATER ALLIGATOR, AFTER A WHILE CROCODILE, DON’T FORGET TO WRITE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Why?”</i> Susannah shouted. <i class="calibre3">“Why</i>, goddam you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “BECAUSE THEY BORE ME. YOU FOUR, HOWEVER, I FIND RATHER INTERESTING. OF COURSE, HOW LONG I <i class="calibre3">CONTINUE</i> TO FIND YOU INTERESTING WILL DEPEND ON HOW GOOD YOUR RIDDLES ARE. AND SPEAKING OF RIDDLES, HADN’T YOU BETTER GET TO WORK SOLVING MINE? YOU HAVE EXACTLY ELEVEN MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS BEFORE THE CANNISTERS RUPTURE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stop it!” Jake yelled over the blatting siren. “It isn’t just the city—gas like that could float <i class="calibre3">anywhere!</i> It could even kill the old people in River Crossing!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “TOUGH TITTY, SAID THE KITTY,” Blaine responded unfeelingly. “ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THEY CAN COUNT ON MEASURING OUT THEIR LIVES IN COFFEE-SPOONS FOR A FEW MORE YEARS; THE AUTUMN STORMS HAVE BEGUN, AND THE PREVAILING WINDS WILL CARRY THE GASES AWAY FROM THEM. THE SITUATION OF YOU FOUR IS, HOWEVER, VERY DIFFERENT. YOU BETTER PUT ON YOUR THINKING CAPS, OR IT’S SEE YOU LATER ALLIGATOR, AFTER A WHILE CROCODILE, DON’T FORGET TO WRITE.” The voice paused. “ONE PIECE OF ADDITIONAL INPUT: THIS GAS IS <i class="calibre3">NOT</i> PAINLESS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Take it back!” Jake said. “We’ll still tell you riddles, won’t we, Roland? We’ll tell all the riddles you want! <i class="calibre3">Just take it back!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine began to laugh. He laughed for a long time, pealing shrieks of electronic mirth into the wide empty space of the Cradle, where it mingled with the monotonous, drilling beat of the alarm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Stop it!” Susannah shouted. “Stop it! Stop it! <i class="calibre3">Stop it!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine did. A moment later the alarm cut off in mid-blat. The ensuing silence—broken only by the pounding rain—was deafening.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now the voice issuing from the speaker was very soft, thoughtful, and utterly without mercy. “YOU NOW HAVE TEN MINUTES,” Blaine said. “LET’S SEE JUST HOW INTERESTING YOU REALLY ARE.”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h40"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_8"><b class="calibre4">40</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “ANDREW.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">There is no Andrew here, stranger, he thought. Andrew is long gone; Andrew is no more, as I shall soon be no more.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“Andrew!”</i> the voice insisted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It came from far away. It came from outside the cider-press that had once been his head.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Once there <i class="calibre3">had</i> been a boy named Andrew, and his father had taken that boy to a park on the far western side of Lud, a park where there had been apple trees and a rusty tin shack that looked like hell and smelled like heaven. In answer to his question, Andrew’s father had told him it was called the cider house. Then he gave Andrew a pat on the head, told him not to be afraid, and led him through the blanket-covered doorway.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There had been more apples—baskets and baskets of them—stacked against the walls inside, and there had also been a scrawny old man named Dewlap, whose muscles writhed beneath his white skin like worms and whose job was to feed the apples, basket by basket, to the loose-jointed, clanking machine which stood in the middle of the room. What came out of the pipe jutting from the far end of the machine was sweet cider. Another man (he no longer remembered what this one’s name might have been) stood there, his job to fill jug after jug with the cider. A third man stood behind <i class="calibre3">him</i>, and <i class="calibre3">his</i> job was to clout the jug-filler on the head if there was too much spillage.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Andrew’s father had given him a glass of the foaming cider, and although he had tasted a great many forgotten delicacies during his years in the city, he had never tasted anything finer than that sweet, cold drink. It had been like swallowing a gust of October wind. Yet what he remembered even more clearly than the taste of the cider or the wormy shift and squiggle of Dewlap’s muscles as he dumped the baskets was the merciless way the machine reduced the big red-gold apples to liquid. Two dozen rollers had carried them beneath a revolving steel drum with holes punched in it. The apples had first been squeezed and then actually popped, spilling their juices down an inclined trough while a screen caught the seeds and pulp.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Now his head was the cider-press and his brains were the apples. Soon they would pop as the apples had popped beneath the roller, and the blessed darkness would swallow him.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Andrew! Raise your head and look at me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He couldn’t . . . and wouldn’t even if he could. Better to just lie here and wait for the darkness. He was supposed to be dead, anyway; hadn’t the hellish squint put a bullet in his brain?
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It didn’t go anywhere near your brain, you horse’s ass, and you’re not dying. You’ve just got a headache. You <i class="calibre3">will</i> die, though, if you don’t stop lying there and puling in your own blood . . . and I will make sure, Andrew, that your dying makes what you are feeling now seem like bliss.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    It was not the threats which caused the man on the floor to raise his head but rather the way the owner of that penetrating, hissing voice seemed to have read his mind. His head came up slowly, and the agony was excruciating—heavy objects seemed to go sliding and careering around the bony case which contained what was left of his mind, ripping bloody channels through his brain as they went. A long, syrupy moan escaped him. There was a flapping, tickling sensation on his right cheek, as if a dozen flies were crawling in the blood there. He wanted to shoo them away, but he knew that he needed both hands just to support himself.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The figure standing on the far side of the room by the hatch which led to the kitchen looked ghastly, unreal. This was partly because the overhead lights were still strobing, partly because he was seeing the newcomer with only one eye (he couldn’t remember what had happened to the other and didn’t want to), but he had an idea it was mostly because the creature <i class="calibre3">was</i> ghastly and unreal. It looked like a man . . . but the fellow who had once been Andrew Quick had an idea it really wasn’t a man at all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The stranger standing in front of the hatch wore a short, dark jacket belted at the waist, faded denim trousers, and old, dusty boots—the boots of a country-man, a range-rider, or—
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Or a gunslinger, Andrew?” the stranger asked, and tittered.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The Tick-Tock Man stared desperately at the figure in the doorway, trying to see the face, but the short jacket had a hood, and it was up. The stranger’s countenance was lost in its shadows.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The siren stopped in mid-whoop. The emergency lights stayed on, but they at least stopped flashing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There,” the stranger said in his—or its—whispery, penetrating voice. “At last we can hear ourselves think.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Who are you?” the Tick-Tock Man asked. He moved slightly, and more of those weights went sliding through his head, ripping fresh channels in his brain. As terrible as that feeling was, the awful tickling of the flies on his right cheek was somehow worse.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m a man of many handles, pardner,” the man said from inside the darkness of his hood, and although his voice was grave, Tick-Tock heard laughter lurking just below the surface. “There’s some that call me Jimmy, and some that call me Timmy; some that call me Handy and some that call me Dandy. They can call me Loser, or they can call me Winner, just as long as they don’t call me in too late for dinner.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The man in the doorway threw back his head, and his laughter chilled the skin of the wounded man’s arms and back into lumps of gooseflesh; it was like the howl of a wolf.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I have been called the Ageless Stranger,” the man said. He began to walk toward Tick-Tock, and as he did, the man on the floor moaned and tried to scrabble backward. “I have also been called Merlin or Maerlyn—and who cares, because I was never <i class="calibre3">that</i> one, although I never denied it, either. I am sometimes called the Magician . . . or the Wizard . . . but I hope we can go forward together on more humble terms, Andrew. More <i class="calibre3">human</i> terms.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He pushed back the hood, revealing a fair, broad-browed face that was not, for all its pleasant looks, in any way human. Large hectic roses rode the Wizard’s cheekbones; his blue-green eyes sparkled with a gusty joy far too wild to be sane; his blue-black hair stood up in zany clumps like the feathers of a raven; his lips, lushly red, parted to reveal the teeth of a cannibal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Call me Fannin,” the grinning apparition said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Richard Fannin. That’s not <i class="calibre3">exactly</i> right, maybe, but I reckon it’s close enough for government work.” He held out a hand whose palm was utterly devoid of lines. “What do you say, pard? Shake the hand that shook the world.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The creature who had once been Andrew Quick and who had been known in the halls of the Grays as the Tick-Tock Man shrieked and again tried to wriggle backward. The flap of scalp peeled loose by the low-caliber bullet which had only grooved his skull instead of penetrating it swung back and forth; the long strands of gray-blonde hair continued to tickle against his cheek. Quick, however, no longer felt it. He had even forgotten the ache in his skull and the throb from the socket where his left eye had been. His entire consciousness had fused into one thought: <i class="calibre3">I must get away from this beast that looks like a man.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But when the stranger seized his right hand and shook it, that thought passed like a dream on waking. The scream which had been locked in Quick’s breast escaped his lips in a lover’s sigh. He stared dumbly up at the grinning newcomer. The loose flap of his scalp swung and dangled.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is that bothering you? It <i class="calibre3">must</i> be. Here!” Fannin seized the hanging flap and ripped it briskly off Quick’s head, revealing a bleary swatch of skull. There was a noise like heavy cloth tearing. Quick shrieked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There, there, it only hurts for a second.” The man was now squatting on his hunkers before Quick and speaking as an indulgent parent might speak to a child with a splinter in his finger. “Isn’t that so?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Y-Y-Yes,” Quick muttered. And it was. Already the pain was fading. And when Fannin reached toward him again, caressing the left side of his face, Quick’s jerk backward was only a reflex, quickly mastered. As the lineless hand stroked, he felt strength flowing back into him. He looked up at the newcomer with dumb gratitude, lips quivering.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Is that better, Andrew? It is, isn’t it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes! Yes!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “If you want to thank me—as I’m sure you do—you must say something an old acquaintance of mine used to say. He ended up betraying me, but he was a good friend for quite some time, anyway, and I still have a soft spot in my heart for him. Say, ‘My life for you,’ Andrew—can you say that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He could and he did; in fact, it seemed he couldn’t <i class="calibre3">stop</i> saying it. “My life for you! My life for you! My life for you! My life—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The stranger touched his cheek again, but this time a huge raw bolt of pain blasted across Andrew Quick’s head. He screamed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Sorry about that, but time is short and you were starting to sound like a broken record. Andrew, let me put it to you with no bark on it: how would you like to kill the squint who shot you? Not to mention his friends and the hardcase who brought him here—him, most of all. Even the mutt that took your eye, Andrew—would you like that?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes!” the former Tick-Tock Man gasped. His hands clenched into bloody fists. <i class="calibre3">“Yes!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s good,” the stranger said, and helped Quick to his feet, “because they <i class="calibre3">have</i> to die—they’re meddling with things they have no business meddling with. I expected Blaine to take care of them, but things have gone much too far to depend on <i class="calibre3">anything</i> ... after all, who would have thought they could get as far as they have?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know,” Quick said. He did not, in fact, have the slightest idea what the stranger was talking about. Nor did he care; there was a feeling of exaltation creeping through his mind like some excellent drug, and after the pain of the cider-press, that was enough for him. More than enough.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Richard Fannin’s lips curled. “Bear and bone . . . key and rose . . . day and night . . . time and tide. <i class="calibre3">Enough!</i> Enough, I <i class="calibre3">say! They must not draw closer to the Tower than they are now!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Quick staggered backward as the man’s hands shot out with the flickery speed of heat lightning. One broke the chain which held the tiny glass-enclosed pendulum clock; the other stripped Jake Chambers’s Seiko from his forearm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’ll just take these, shall I?” Fannin the Wizard smiled charmingly, his lips modestly closed over those awful teeth. “Or do you object?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “No,” Quick said, surrendering the last symbols of his long leadership without a qualm (without, in fact, even being aware that he was doing so). “Be my guest.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Thank you, Andrew,” the dark man said softly. “Now we must step lively—I’m expecting a drastic change in the atmosphere of these environs in the next five minutes or so. We must get to the nearest closet where gas masks are stored before that happens, and it’s apt to be a near thing. I could survive the change quite nicely, but I’m afraid you might have some difficulties.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” Andrew Quick said. His head had begun to throb again, and his mind was whirling.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nor do you need to,” the stranger said smoothly. “Come, Andrew—I think we should hurry. Busy, busy day, eh? With luck, Blaine will fry them right on the platform, where they are no doubt still standing—he’s become very eccentric over the years, poor fellow. But I think we should hurry, just the same.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He slid his arm over Quick’s shoulders and, giggling, led him through the hatchway Roland and Jake had used only a few minutes before.
