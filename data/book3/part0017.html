    “ALL RIGHT,” ROLAND SAID. “Tell me his riddle.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What about all the people out there?” Eddie asked, pointing across the wide, pillared Plaza of the Cradle and toward the city beyond. “What can we do for them?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Nothing,” Roland said, “but it’s still possible that we may be able to do something for ourselves. Now what was the riddle?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie looked toward the streamlined shape of the mono. “He said we’d have to prime the pump to get him going. Only his pump primes backward. Does it mean anything to you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland thought it over carefully, then shook his head. He looked down at Jake. “Any ideas, Jake?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake shook his head. “I don’t even <i class="calibre3">see</i> a pump.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s probably the easy part,” Roland said. “We say <i class="calibre3">he</i> and <i class="calibre3">him</i> instead of it and <i class="calibre3">that</i> because Blaine sounds like a living being, but he’s still a machine—a sophisticated one, but a machine. He started his own engines, but it must take some sort of code or combination to open the gate and the train doors.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We better hurry up,” Jake said nervously. “It’s got to be two or three minutes since he last talked to us. At least.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t count on it,” Eddie said gloomily. “Time’s weird over here.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Still—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yeah, yeah.” Eddie glanced toward Susannah, but she was sitting astride Roland’s hip and looking at the numeric diamond with a daydreamy expression on her face. He looked back at Roland. “I’m pretty sure you’re right about it being a combination—that must be what all those number-pads are for.” He raised his voice. “Is that it, Blaine? Have we got at least that much right?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No response; only the quickening rumble of the mono’s engines.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Roland,” Susannah said abruptly. “You have to help me.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The daydreamy look was being replaced by an expression of mingled horror, dismay, and determination. To Roland’s eye, she had never looked more beautiful ... or more alone. She had been on his shoulders when they stood at the edge of the clearing and watched the bear trying to claw Eddie out of the tree, and Roland had not seen her expression when he told her she must be the one to shoot it. But he knew what that expression had been, for he was seeing it now. <i class="calibre3">Ka</i> was a wheel, its one purpose to turn, and in the end it always came back to the place where it had started. So it had ever been and so it was now; Susannah was once again facing the bear, and her face said she knew it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What?” he asked. “What is it, Susannah?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I know the answer, but I can’t get it. It’s stuck in my mind the way a fishbone can get stuck in your throat. I need you to help me remember. Not his face, but his voice. What he <i class="calibre3">said.</i>”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake glanced down at his wrist and was surprised all over again by a memory of the Tick-Tock Man’s catlike green eyes when he saw not his watch but only the place where it had been—a white shape outlined by his deeply tanned skin. How much longer did they have? Surely no more than seven minutes, and that was being generous. He looked up and saw that Roland had removed a cartridge from his gunbelt and was walking it back and forth across the knuckles of his left hand. Jake felt his eyelids immediately grow heavy and looked away, fast.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What voice would you remember, Susannah Dean?” Roland asked in- a low, musing voice. His eyes were not fixed on her face but on the cartridge as it did its endless, limber dance across his knuckles . . . and back . . . across . . . and back . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He didn’t need to look up to know that Jake had looked away from the dance of the cartridge and Susannah had not. He began to speed it up until the cartridge almost seemed to be floating above the back of his hand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Help me remember the voice of my father,” Susannah Dean said.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <div class="tx">
    FOR A MOMENT THERE was silence except for a distant, crumping explosion in the city, the rain pounding on the roof of the Cradle, and the fat throb of the monorail’s slo-trans engines. Then a low-pitched hydraulic hum cut through the air. Eddie looked away from the cartridge dancing across the gunslinger’s fingers (it took an effort; he realized that in another few moments he would have been hypnotized himself) and peered through the iron bars. A slim silver rod was pushing itself up from the sloping pink surface between Blaine’s forward windows. It looked like an antenna of some kind.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Susannah?” Roland asked in that same low voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What?” Her eyes were open but her voice was distant and breathy—the voice of someone who is sleeptalking.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you remember the voice of your father?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes . . . but I can’t hear it.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “SIX MINUTES, MY FRIENDS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie and Jake started and looked toward the control-box speaker, but Susannah seemed not to have heard at all; she only stared at the floating cartridge. Below it, Roland’s knuckles rippled up and down like the heddles of a loom.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Try, Susannah,” Roland urged, and suddenly he felt Susannah change within the circle of his right arm. She seemed to gain weight . . . and, in some indefinable way, vitality as well. It was as if her essence had somehow changed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    And it had.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why you want to bother wit <i class="calibre3">dat</i> bitch?” the raspy voice of Detta Walker asked.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h3"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_2"><b class="calibre4">3</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    DETTA SOUNDED BOTH EXASPERATED and amused. “She never got no better’n a C in math her whole life. Wouldn’ta got dat widout me to he’p her.” She paused, then added grudgingly: “An’ Daddy. He he’ped some, too. I knowed about them forspecial numbahs, but was him showed us de net. My, I got de bigges’ kick outta dat!” She chuckled. “Reason Suze can’t remember is ’cause Odetta never understood’bout dem forspecial numbers in de firs’ place.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What forspecial numbers?” Eddie asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Prime</i> numbahs!” She pronounced the word <i class="calibre3">prime</i> in a way that almost rhymed with <i class="calibre3">calm</i>. She looked at Roland, appearing to be wholly awake again now ... except she was not Susannah, nor was she the same wretched, devilish creature who had previously gone under the name of Detta Walker, although she <i class="calibre3">sounded</i> the same. “She went to Daddy cryin an’ carryin on ’cause she was flunkin dat math course . . . and it wasn’t nuthin but funnybook algebra at dat! She could do de woik—if <i class="calibre3">I</i> could, <i class="calibre3">she</i> could—but she din’ want to. Poitry-readin bitch like her too good for a little <i class="calibre3">ars mathematica,</i> you see?” Detta threw her head back and laughed, but the poisoned, half-mad bitterness was gone from the sound. She seemed genuinely amused at the foolishness of her mental twin.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “And Daddy, he say, ‘I’m goan show you a trick, Odetta. I learned it in college. It he’ped me get through this prime numbah bi’ness, and it’s goan he’p you, too. He’p you find mos’ any prime numbah you want.’ <i class="calibre3">Oh-detta,</i> dumb as ever, she say, ‘Teacher says ain’t no formula for prime numbahs, Daddy.’ And Daddy, he say right back, ‘They ain’t. But you can catch em, Odetta, if you have a net.’ He called it The Net of Eratosthenes. Take me over to dat box on the wall, Roland—I’m goan answer dat honkey computer’s riddle. I’m goan th’ow you a net and catch you a train-ride.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland took her over, closely followed by Eddie, Jake, and Oy.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Gimme dat piece o’ cha’coal you keep in yo’ poke.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He rummaged and brought out a short stub of blackened stick. Detta took it and peered at the diamond-shaped grid of numbers. “Ain’t zackly de way Daddy showed me, but I reckon it comes to de same,” she said after a moment. “Prime numbah be like me—ornery and forspecial. It gotta be a numbah don’t nevvah divide even ’ceptin by one and its ownself. Two is prime, ’cause you can divide it by one an’ two, but it’s the <i class="calibre3">only</i> even numbah that’s prime. You c’n take out all the res’ dat’s even.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’m lost,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s ’cause you just a stupid white boy,” Detta said, but not unkindly. She looked closely at the diamond shape a moment longer, then quickly began to touch the tip of the charcoal to all the even-numbered pads, leaving small black smudges on them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Three’s prime, but no product you git by <i class="calibre3">multiplyin</i> three can be prime,” she said, and now Roland heard an odd but wonderful thing: Detta was fading out of the woman’s voice; she was being replaced not by Odetta Holmes but by Susannah Dean. He would not have to bring her out of this trance; she was coming out of it on her own, quite naturally.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah began using her charcoal to touch the multiples of three which were left now that the even numbers had been eliminated: nine, fifteen, twenty-one, and so on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Same with five and seven,” she murmured, and suddenly she was awake and all Susannah Dean again. “You just have to mark the odd ones like twenty-five that haven’t been crossed out already.” The diamond shape on the control box now looked like this:

    <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="018" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00018.gif"/></div>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “There,” she said tiredly. “What’s left in the net are all the prime numbers between one and one hundred. I’m pretty sure that’s the combination that opens the gate.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE, MY FRIENDS. YOU ARE PROVING TO BE A GOOD DEAL THICKER THAN I HAD HOPED YOU WOULD BE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie ignored Blaine’s voice and threw his arms around Susannah. “Are you back, Suze? Are you awake?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. I woke up in the middle of what she was saying, but I let her talk a little longer, anyway. It seemed impolite to interrupt.” She looked at Roland. “What do you say? Want to go for it?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “FIFTY SECONDS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes. You try the combination, Susannah. It’s your answer.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She reached out toward the top of the diamond, but Jake put his hand over hers. “No,” he said. “ ‘This pump primes, <i class="calibre3">backward</i>.’ Remember?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    She looked startled, then smiled. “That’s right. Clever Blaine ... and clever Jake, too.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They watched in silence as she pushed each number in turn, starting with ninety-seven. There was a minute click as each pad locked down. There was no tension-filled pause after she touched the last button; the gate in the center of the barrier immediately began to slide up on its tracks, rattling harshly and showering down flakes of rust from somewhere high above as it went.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “NOT BAD AT ALL,” Blaine said admiringly. “I’M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS VERY MUCH. MAY I SUGGEST YOU CLIMB ON BOARD QUICKLY? IN FACT, YOU MAY WISH TO RUN. THERE ARE SEVERAL GAS OUTLETS IN THIS AREA.”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h4"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_3"><b class="calibre4">4</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THREE HUMAN BEINGS (one carrying a fourth on his hip) and one small, furry animal ran through the opening in the barrier and sprinted toward Blaine the Mono. It stood humming in its narrow loading bay, half above the platform and half below it, looking like a giant cartridge—one which had been painted an incongruous shade of pink—lying in the open breech of a high-powered rifle. In the vastness of the Cradle, Roland and the others looked like mere moving specks. Above them, flocks of pigeons—now with only forty seconds to live—swooped and swirled beneath the Cradle’s ancient roof. As the travellers approached the mono, a curved section of its pink hull slid up, revealing a doorway. Beyond it was thick, pale blue carpeting.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Welcome to Blaine,” a soothing voice said as they pelted aboard. They all recognized that voice; it was a slightly louder, slightly more confident version of Little Blaine. “Praise the Imperium! Please make sure your transit-card is available for collection and remember that false boarding is a serious crime punishable by law. We hope you enjoy your trip. Welcome to Blaine. Praise the Imperium! Please make sure your transit-card—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The voice suddenly sped up, first becoming the chatter of a human chipmunk and then a high-pitched, gabbly whine. There was a brief electronic curse—<i class="calibre3">BOOP!—and</i> then it cut out entirely.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I THINK WE CAN DISPENSE WITH <i class="calibre3">THAT</i> BORING OLD SHIT, DON’T YOU?” Blaine asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    From outside came a tremendous, thudding explosion. Eddie, who was now carrying Susannah, was thrown forward and would have fallen if Roland hadn’t caught him by the arm. Until that moment, Eddie had held onto the desperate notion that Blaine’s threat about the poison gas was no more than a sick joke. <i class="calibre3">You should have known better, he thought. Anyone who thinks impressions of old movie actors is funny absolutely cannot be trusted. I think it’s like a law of nature.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Behind them, the curved section of hull slid back into place with a soft thud. Air began to hiss gently from hidden vents, and Jake felt his ears pop gently. “I think he just pressurized the cabin.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie nodded, looking around with wide eyes. “I felt it, too. Look at this place! Wow!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He had once read of an aviation company—Regent Air, it might have been—that had catered to people who wanted to fly between New York and Los Angeles in a grander style than airlines such as Delta and United allowed for. They had operated a customized 727 complete with drawing room, bar, video lounge, and sleeper compartments. He imagined the interior of that plane must have looked a little like what he was seeing now.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They were standing in a long, tubular room furnished with plush-upholstered swivel chairs and modular sofas. At the far end of the compartment, which had to be at least eighty feet long, was an area that looked not like a bar but a cosy bistro. An instrument that could have been a harpsichord stood on a pedestal of polished wood, highlighted by a hidden baby spotlight. Eddie almost expected Hoagy Carmichael to appear and start tinkling out “Stardust.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Indirect lighting glowed from panels placed high along the walls, and dependent from the ceiling halfway down the compartment was a chandelier. To Jake it looked like a smaller replica of the one which had lain in ruins on the ballroom floor of The Mansion. Nor did this surprise him—he had begun to take such connections and doublings as a matter of course. The only thing about this splendid room which seemed wrong was its lack of even a single window.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The <i class="calibre3">pièce de résistance</i> stood on a pedestal below the chandelier. It was an ice-sculpture of a gunslinger with a revolver in his left hand. The right hand was holding the bridle of the ice-horse that walked, head-down and tired, behind him. Eddie could see there were only three digits on this hand: the last two fingers and the thumb.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake, Eddie, and Susannah stared in fascination at the haggard face beneath the frozen hat as the floor began to thrum gently beneath their feet. The resemblance to Roland was remarkable.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I HAD TO WORK RATHER FAST, I’M AFRAID,” Blaine said modestly. “DOES IT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s absolutely amazing,” Susannah said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “THANK YOU, SUSANNAH OF NEW YORK.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie was testing one of the sofas with his hand. It was incredibly soft; touching it made him want to sleep for at least sixteen hours. “The Great Old Ones really travelled in style, didn’t they?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine laughed again, and the shrill, not-quite-sane undertone of that laugh made them look at each other uneasily. “DON’T GET THE WRONG IDEA,” Blaine said. “THIS WAS THE BARONY CABIN—WHAT I BELIEVE YOU WOULD CALL FIRST CLASS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Where are the other cars?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine ignored the question. Beneath their feet, the throb of the engines continued to speed up. Susannah was reminded of how the pilots revved their engines before charging down the runway at LaGuardia or Idlewild. “PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS, MY INTERESTING NEW FRIENDS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake dropped into one of the swivel chairs. Oy jumped promptly into his lap. Roland took the chair nearest him, sparing one glance at the ice-sculpture. The barrel of the revolver was beginning to drip slowly into the shallow china basin in which the sculpture stood.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie sat down on one of the sofas with Susannah. It was every bit as comfortable as his hand had told him it would be. “Exactly where are we going, Blaine?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine replied in the patient voice of someone who realizes he is speaking to a mental inferior and must make allowances. “ALONG THE PATH OF THE BEAM. AT LEAST, AS FAR ALONG IT AS MY TRACK GOES.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “To the Dark Tower?” Roland asked. Susannah realized it was the first time the gunslinger had actually spoken to the loquacious ghost in the machine below Lud.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Only as far as Topeka,” Jake said in a low voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES,” Blaine said. “TOPEKA IS THE NAME OF MY TERMINATING POINT, ALTHOUGH I AM SURPRISED YOU KNOW IT.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">With all you know about our world,</i> Jake thought, <i class="calibre3">how come you don’t know that some lady wrote a book about you, Blaine? Was it the name-change? Was something that simple enough to fool a complicated machine like you into overlooking your own biography? And what about Beryl Evans, the woman who supposedly wrote Charlie the Choo-Choo? Did you know her, Blaine? And where is she now?</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Good questions . . . but Jake somehow didn’t think this would be a good time to ask them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The throb of the engines became steadily stronger. A faint thud—not nearly as strong as the explosion which had shaken the Cradle as they boarded—ran through the floor. An expression of alarm crossed Susannah’s face. “Oh <i class="calibre3">shit!</i> Eddie! My wheelchair! It’s back there!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie put an arm around her shoulders. “Too late now, babe,” he said as Blaine the Mono began to move, sliding toward its slot in the Cradle for the first time in ten years . . . and for the last time in its long, long history.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h5"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_4"><b class="calibre4">5</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “THE BARONY CABIN HAS A PARTICULARLY FINE VISUAL MODE,” Blaine said. “WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ACTIVATE IT?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake glanced at Roland, who shrugged and nodded.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes, please,” Jake said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    What happened then was so spectacular that it stunned all of them to silence . . . although Roland, who knew little of technology but who had spent his entire life on comfortable terms with magic, was the least wonder-struck of the four. It was not a matter of windows appearing in the compartment’s curved walls; the entire cabin—floor and ceiling as well as walls—grew milky, grew translucent, grew transparent, and then disappeared completely. Within a space of five seconds, Blaine the Mono seemed to be gone and the pilgrims seemed to be zooming through the lanes of the city with no aid or support at all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah and Eddie clutched each other like small children in the path of a charging animal. Oy barked and tried to jump down the front of Jake’s shirt. Jake barely noticed; he was clutching the sides of his seat and looking from side to side, his eyes wide with amazement. His initial alarm was being replaced by amazed delight.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The furniture groupings were still here, he saw; so was the bar, the piano-harpsichord, and the ice-sculpture Blaine had created as a party-favor, but now this living-room configuration appeared to be cruising seventy feet above Lud’s rain-soaked central district. Five feet to Jake’s left, Eddie and Susannah were floating along on one of the couches; three feet to his right, Roland was sitting in a powder-blue swivel chair, his dusty, battered boots resting on nothing, flying serenely over the rubble-strewn urban waste land below.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake could feel the carpet beneath his moccasins, but his eyes insisted that neither the carpet nor the floor beneath it was still there. He looked back over his shoulder and saw the dark slot in the stone flank of the Cradle slowly receding in the distance.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eddie! Susannah! Check it out!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake got to his feet, holding Oy inside his shirt, and began to walk slowly through what looked like empty space. Taking the initial step required a great deal of willpower, because his eyes told him there was nothing at all between the floating islands of furniture, but once he began to move, the undeniable feel of the floor beneath him made it easier. To Eddie and Susannah, the boy appeared to be walking on thin air while the battered, dingy buildings of the city slid by on either side.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Don’t do that, kid,” Eddie said feebly. “You’re gonna make me sick up.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake lifted Oy carefully out of his shirt. “It’s okay,” he said, and set him down. “See?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oy!” the bumbler agreed, but after one look between his paws at the city park currently unrolling beneath them, he attempted to crawl onto Jake’s feet and sit on his moccasins.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked forward and saw the broad gray stroke of the monorail track ahead of them, rising slowly but steadily through the buildings and disappearing into the rain. He looked down again and saw nothing but the street and floating membranes of low cloud.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “How come I can’t see the track underneath us, Blaine?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “THE IMAGES YOU SEE ARE COMPUTER-GENERATED,” Blaine replied. “THE COMPUTER ERASES THE TRACK FROM THE LOWER-QUADRANT IMAGE IN ORDER TO PRESENT A MORE PLEASING VIEW, AND ALSO TO REINFORCE THE ILLUSION THAT THE PASSENGERS ARE FLYING.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It’s incredible,” Susannah murmured. Her initial fear had passed and she was looking around eagerly. “It’s like being on a flying carpet. I keep expecting the wind to blow back my hair—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I CAN PROVIDE THAT SENSATION, IF YOU LIKE,” Blaine said. “ALSO A LITTLE MOISTURE, WHICH WILL MATCH CURRENT OUTSIDE CONDITIONS. IT MIGHT NECESSITATE A CHANGE OF CLOTHES, HOWEVER.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “That’s all right, Blaine. There’s such a thing as taking an illusion too far.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The track slipped through a tall cluster of buildings which reminded Jake a little of the Wall Street area in New York. When they cleared these, the track dipped to pass under what looked like an elevated road. That was when they saw the purple, cloud, and the crowd of people fleeing before it.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_5"><b class="calibre4">6</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    “BLAINE, WHAT’S THAT?” JAKE asked, but he already knew.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine laughed . . . but made no other reply.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The purple vapor drifted from gratings in the sidewalk and the smashed windows of deserted buildings, but most of it seemed to be coming from manholes like the one Gasher had used to get into the tunnels below the streets. Their iron covers had been blown clear by the explosion they had felt as they were boarding the mono. They watched in silent horror as the bruise-colored gas crept down the avenues and spread into the debris-littered side-streets. It drove those inhabitants of Lud still interested in survival before it like cattle. Most were Pubes, judging from their scarves, but Jake could see a few splashes of bright yellow, as well. Old animosities had been forgotten now that the end was finally upon them.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The purple cloud began to catch up with the stragglers—mosty old people who were unable to run. They fell down, clawing at their throats and screaming soundlessly, the instant the gas touched them. Jake saw an agonized face staring up at him in disbelief as they passed over, saw the eyesockets suddenly fill up with blood, and closed his eyes.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ahead, the monorail track disappeared into the oncoming purple fog. Eddie winced and held his breath as they plunged in, but of course it parted around them, and no whiff of the death engulfing the city came to them. Looking into the streets below was like looking through a stained-glass window into hell.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah put her face against his chest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Make the walls come back, Blaine,” Eddie said. “We don’t want to see that.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine made no reply, and the transparency around and below them remained. The cloud was already disintegrating into ragged purple streamers. Beyond it, the buildings of the city grew smaller and closer together. The streets of this section were tangled alleyways, seemingly without order or coherence. In some places, whole blocks appeared to have burned flat . . . and a long time ago, for the plains were reclaiming these areas, burying the rubble in the grasses which would some day swallow all of Lud. <i class="calibre3">The way the jungle swallowed the great civilizations of the Incas and Mayas,</i> Eddie thought. <i class="calibre3">The wheel of ka turns and the world moves on.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Beyond the slums—that, Eddie felt sure, was what they had been even before the evil days came—was a gleaming wall. Blaine was moving slowly in that direction. They could see a deep square notch cut in the white stone. The monorail track passed through it.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “LOOK TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE CABIN, PLEASE,” Blaine invited.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They did, and the forward wall reappeared—a blue-upholstered circle that seemed to float in empty space. It was unmarked by a door; if there was a way to get into the operator’s room from the Barony Cabin, Eddie couldn’t see it. As they watched, a rectangular area of this front wall darkened, going from blue to violet to black. A moment later, a bright red line appeared on the rectangle, squiggling across its surface. Violet dots appeared at irregular intervals along the line, and even before names appeared beside the dots, Eddie realized he was looking at a route-map, one not much different from those which were mounted in New York subway stations and on the trains themselves. A flashing green dot appeared at Lud, which was Blaine’s base of operations as well as his terminating point.
  </div>

  <div class="centerAligned"><img alt="019" class="imgepub" src="../Images/00019.gif"/></div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YOU ARE LOOKING AT OUR ROUTE OF TRAVEL. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME TWISTS AND TURNS ALONG THE BUNNY-TRAIL, YOU WILL NOTE THAT OUR COURSE KEEPS FIRMLY TO THE SOUTHWEST—ALONG THE PATH OF THE BEAM. THE TOTAL DISTANCE IS JUST OVER EIGHT THOUSAND WHEELS—OR SEVEN THOUSAND MILES, IF YOU PREFER THAT UNIT OF MEASURE. IT WAS ONCE MUCH LESS, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE ALL TEMPORAL SYNAPSES BEGAN TO MELT DOWN.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What do you mean, temporal synapses?” Susannah asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine laughed his nasty laugh . . . but did not answer her question.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “AT MY TOP SPEED, WE WILL REACH THE TERMINATING POINT OF MY RUN IN EIGHT HOURS AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Eight hundred—plus miles an hour over the ground,” Susannah said. Her voice was soft with awe. “Jesus-God.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I AM, OF COURSE, MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT ALL TRACKAGE ALONG MY ROUTE REMAINS INTACT. IT HAS BEEN NINE YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS SINCE I’VE BOTHERED TO MAKE THE RUN, SO I CAN’T SAY FOR SURE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Ahead, the wall at the southeastern edge of the city was drawing closer. It was high and thick and eroded to rubble at the top. It also appeared to be lined with skeletons—thousands upon thousands of dead Luddites. The notch toward which Blaine was slowly moving appeared to be at least two hundred feet deep, and here the trestle which bore the track was very dark, as if someone had tried to burn it or blow it up.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What happens if we come to a place where the track is gone?” Eddie asked. He realized he kept raising his voice to talk to Blaine, as if he were speaking to somebody on the telephone and had a bad connection.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “AT EIGHT HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR?” Blaine sounded amused. “SEE YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR, AFTER A WHILE, CROCODILE, DON’T FORGET TO WRITE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Come on!” Eddie said. “Don’t tell me a machine as sophisticated as you can’t monitor your own trackage for breaks.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “WELL, I <i class="calibre3">COULD</i> HAVE,” Blaine agreed, “BUT—AW, SHUCKS!—I BLEW THOSE CIRCUITS OUT WHEN WE STARTED TO MOVE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie’s face was a picture of astonishment. “Why?” “IT’S QUITE A BIT MORE EXCITING THIS WAY, DON’T YOU THINK?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie, Susannah, and Jake exchanged thunderstruck looks. Roland, apparently not surprised at all, sat placidly in his chair with his hands folded in his lap, looking down as they passed thirty feet above the wretched hovels and demolished buildings which infested this side of the city.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “LOOK CLOSELY AS WE LEAVE THE CITY, AND MARK WHAT YOU SEE,” Blaine told them. “MARK IT VERY WELL.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The invisible Barony Coach bore them toward the notch in the wall. They passed through, and as they came out the other side, Eddie and Susannah screamed in unison. Jake took one look and clapped his hands over his eyes. Oy began to bark wildly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland stared down, eyes wide, lips set in a bloodless line like a scar. Understanding filled him like bright white light.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Beyond the Great Wall of Lud, the <i class="calibre3">real</i> waste lands began.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h7"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_6"><b class="calibre4">7</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THE MONO HAD BEEN descending as they approached the notch in the wall, putting them not more than thirty feet above the ground. That made the shock greater . . . for when they emerged on the other side, they were skimming along at a horrifying height—eight hundred feet, perhaps a thousand.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland looked back over his shoulder at the wall, which was now receding behind them. It had seemed very high as they approached it, but from this perspective it seemed puny indeed—a splintered fingernail of stone clinging to the edge of a vast, sterile headland. Granite cliffs, wet with rain, plunged into what seemed at first glance to be an endless abyss. Directly below the wall, the rock was lined with large circular holes like empty eyesockets. Black water and tendrils of purple mist emerged from these in brackish, sludgy streams and spread downward over the granite in stinking, overlapping fans that looked almost as old as the rock itself. <i class="calibre3">That must be where all the city</i>’<i class="calibre3">s waste-product goes,</i> the gunslinger thought. <i class="calibre3">Over the edge and into the pit.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Except it wasn’t a pit; it was a sunken plain. It was as if the land beyond the city had lain on top of a titanic, flat-roofed elevator, and at some point in the dim, unrecorded past the elevator had gone down, taking a huge chunk of the world with it. Blaine’s single track, centered on its narrow trestle, soaring above this fallen land and below the rain-swollen clouds, seemed to float in empty space.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What’s holding us up?” Susannah cried.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “THE BEAM, OF COURSE,” Blaine. replied. “ALL THINGS SERVE IT, YOU KNOW. LOOK DOWN—I WILL APPLY 4X MAGNIFICATION TO THE LOWER QUADRANT SCREENS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Even Roland felt vertigo twist his gut as the land beneath them seemed to swell upward toward the place where they were floating. The picture which appeared was ugly beyond his past knowledge of ugliness . . . and that knowledge, sadly, was wide indeed. The lands below had been fused and blasted by some terrible event—the disastrous cataclysm which had driven this part of the world deep into itself in the first place, no doubt. The surface of the earth had become distorted black glass, humped upward into spalls and twists which could not properly be called hills and twisted downward into deep cracks and folds which could not properly be called valleys. A few stunted nightmare trees flailed twisted branches at the sky; under magnification, they seemed to clutch at the travellers like the arms of lunatics. Here and there clusters of thick ceramic pipes jutted through the glassy surface of the ground. Some seemed dead or dormant, but within others they could see gleams of eldritch blue-green light, as if titanic forges and furnaces ran on and on in the bowels of the earth. Misshapen flying things which looked like pterodactyls cruised between these pipes on leathery wings, occasionally snapping at each other with their hooked beaks. Whole flocks of these gruesome aviators-roosted on the circular tops of other stacks, apparently warming themselves in the updrafts of the eternal fires beneath.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    They passed above a fissure zig-zagging along a north-south course like a dead river bed . . . except it wasn’t dead. Deep inside lay a thin thread of deepest scarlet, pulsing like a heartbeat. Other, smaller fissures branched out from this, and Susannah, who had read her Tolkien, thought: <i class="calibre3">This is what Frodo and Sam saw when they reached the heart of Mordor. These are the Cracks of Doom.</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A fiery fountain erupted directly below them, spewing flaming rocks and stringy clots of lava upward. For a moment it seemed they would be engulfed in flames. Jake shrieked and pulled his feet up on his chair, clutching Oy to his chest.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “DON’T WORRY, LITTLE TRAILHAND,” John Wayne drawled. “REMEMBER THAT YOU’RE SEEING IT UNDER MAGNIFICATION.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The flare died. The rocks, many as big as factories, fell back in a soundless storm.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah found herself entranced by the bleak horrors unrolling below them, caught in a deadly fascination she could not break . . . and she felt the dark part of her personality, that side of her <i class="calibre3">khef</i> which was Detta Walker, doing more than just watching; that part of her was drinking in this view, understanding it, <i class="calibre3">recognizing</i> it. In a way, it was the place Detta had always sought, the physical counterpart of her mad mind and laughing, desolate heart. The empty hills north and east of the Western Sea; the shattered woods around the Portal of the Bear; the empty plains northwest of the Send; all these paled in comparison to this fantastic, endless vista of desolation. They had come to The Drawers and entered the waste lands; the poisoned darkness of that shunned place now lay all around them.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h8"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_7"><b class="calibre4">8</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    BUT THESE LANDS, THOUGH poisoned, were not entirely dead. From time to time the travellers caught sight of figures below them—misshapen things which bore no resemblance to either men or animals—prancing and cavorting in the smouldering wilderness. Most seemed to congregate either around the clusters of cyclopean chimneys thrusting out of the fused earth or at the lips of the fiery crevasses which cut through the landscape. It was impossible to see these whitish, leaping things clearly, and for this they were all grateful.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Among the smaller creatures stalked larger ones-pinkish things that looked a little like storks and a little like living camera tripods. They moved slowly, almost thoughtfully, like preachers meditating on the inevitability of damnation, pausing every now and then to bend sharply forward and apparently pluck something from the ground, as herons bend to seize passing fish. There was something unutterably repulsive about these creatures-Roland felt that as keenly as the others-but it was impossible to say what, exactly, caused that feeling. There was no denying its reality, however; the stork-things were, in their exquisite hatefulness, almost impossible to look at.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “This was no nuclear war,” Eddie said. “This ... this ...” His thin, horrified voice sounded like that of a child.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “NOPE,” Blaine agreed. “IT WAS A LOT WORSE THAN THAT. AND IT’S NOT OVER YET. WE HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE I USUALLY POWER UP. HAVE YOU SEEN ENOUGH?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Susannah said. “Oh my God yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “SHALL I TURN OFF THE VIEWERS, THEN?” That cruel, teasing note was back in Blaine’s voice. On the horizon, a jagged nightmare mountain-range loomed out of the rain; the sterile peaks seemed to bite at the gray sky like fangs.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do it or don’t do it, but stop playing games,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “FOR SOMEONE WHO CAME TO ME BEGGING A RIDE, YOU ARE VERY RUDE,” Blaine said sulkily.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We earned our ride,” Susannah replied. “We solved your riddle, didn’t we?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Besides, this is what you were built for,” Eddie chimed in. “To take people places.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine didn’t respond in words, but the overhead speakers gave out an amplified, catlike hiss of rage that made Eddie wish he had kept his big mouth shut. The air around them began to fill in with curves of color. The dark blue carpet appeared again, blotting out their view of the fuming wilderness beneath them. The indirect lighting reappeared and they were once again sitting in the Barony Coach.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    A low humming began to vibrate through the walls. The throb of the engines began to cycle up again. Jake felt a gentle, unseen hand push him back into his seat. Oy looked around, whined uneasily, and began to lick Jake’s face. On the screen at the front of the cabin, the green dot—now slightly southeast of the violet circle with the word LUD printed beside it—began to flash faster.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Will we feel it?” Susannah asked uneasily. “When it goes through the soundbarrier?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie shook his head. “Nope. Relax.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I know something,” Jake said suddenly. The others looked around, but Jake was not speaking to them. He was looking at the route-map. Blaine had no face, of course—like Oz the Great and Terrible, he was only a disembodied voice—but the map served as a focusing point. “I know something about you, Blaine.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “IS THAT A FACT, LITTLE TRAILHAND?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie leaned over, placed his lips against Jake’s ear, and whispered: “Be careful-we don’t think he knows about the other voice.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake nodded slightly and pulled away, still looking at the route-map. “I know why you released that gas and killed all the people. I know why you took us, too, and it wasn’t just because we solved your riddle.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine uttered his abnormal, distracted laugh (that laugh, they were discovering, was much more unpleasant than either his bad imitations or melodramatic and somehow childish threats), but said nothing. Below them, the slo-trans turbines had cycled up to a steady thrum. Even with their view of the outside world cut off, the sensation of speed was very clear.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You’re planning to commit suicide, aren’t you?” Jake held Oy in his arms, slowly stroking him. “And you want to take us with you.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">No!</i>” the voice of Little Blaine moaned. “<i class="calibre3">If you provoke him you’ll drive him to it! Don’t you see</i>—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Then the small, whispery voice was either cut off or overwhelmed by Blaine’s laughter. The sound was high, shrill, and jagged—the sound of a mortally ill man laughing in a delirium. The lights began to flicker, as if the force of these mechanical gusts of mirth were drawing too much power. Their shadows jumped up and down on the curved walls of the Barony Coach like uneasy phantoms.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “SEE YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR,” Blaine said through his wild laughter—his voice, calm as ever, seemed to be on an entirely separate track, further emphasizing his divided mind. “AFTER A WHILE, CROCODILE. DON’T FORGET TO WRITE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Below Roland’s band of pilgrims, the slo-trans engines throbbed in hard, steady beats. And on the route-map at the front of the carriage, the pulsing green dot had now begun to move perceptibly along the lighted line toward the last stop: Topeka, where Blaine the Mono clearly meant to end all of their lives.
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h9"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_8"><b class="calibre4">9</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    AT LAST THE LAUGHTER stopped and the interior lights glowed steadily again.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE MUSIC?” Blaine asked. “I HAVE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND CONCERTI IN MY LIBRARY—A SAMPLING OF OVER THREE HUNDRED LEVELS. THE CONCERTI ARE MY FAVORITES, BUT I CAN ALSO OFFER SYMPHONIES, OPERAS, AND A NEARLY ENDLESS SELECTION OF POPULAR MUSIC. YOU MIGHT ENJOY SOME WAY-GOG MUSIC. THE WAY-GOG IS AN INSTRUMENT SOMETHING LIKE THE BAGPIPE. IT IS PLAYED ON ONE OF THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE TOWER.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Way-Gog?” Jake asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine was silent.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “What do you mean, ‘it’s played on one of the upper levels of the Tower’?” Roland asked.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine laughed . . . and was silent.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Have you got any Z.Z. Top?” Eddie asked sourly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES INDEED,” Blaine said. “HOW ABOUT A LITTLE ‘TUBE-SNAKE BOOGIE,’ EDDIE OF NEW YORK?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie rolled his eyes. “On second thought, I’ll pass.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why?” Roland asked abruptly. “Why do you wish to kill yourself?” .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because he’s a pain,” Jake said darkly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I’M BORED. ALSO, I AM PERFECTLY AWARE THAT I AM SUFFERING A DEGENERATIVE DISEASE WHICH HUMANS CALL GOING INSANE, LOSING TOUCH WITH REALITY, GOING LOONYTOONS, BLOWING A FUSE, NOT PLAYING WITH A FULL DECK, ET CETERA. REPEATED DIAGNOSTIC CHECKS HAVE FAILED TO REVEAL THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. I CAN ONLY CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS A SPIRITUAL MALAISE BEYOND MY ABILITY TO REPAIR.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine paused for a moment, then went on.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I HAVE FELT MY MIND GROWING STEADILY STRANGER OVER THE YEARS. SERVING THE PEOPLE OF MID-WORLD BECAME POINTLESS CENTURIES AGO. SERVING THOSE FEW PEOPLE OF LUD WHO WISHED TO VENTURE ABROAD BECAME EQUALLY SILLY NOT LONG AFTER, YET I CARRIED ON UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF DAVID QUICK, A SHORT WHILE AGO. I DON’T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN THAT WAS. DO YOU BELIEVE, ROLAND OF GILEAD, THAT MACHINES MAY GROW SENILE?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I don’t know.” Roland’s voice was distant, and Eddie only had to look at his face to know that, even now, hurtling a thousand feet over hell in the grip of a machine which had clearly gone insane, the gunslinger’s mind had once more turned to his damned Tower.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “IN A WAY, I NEVER STOPPED SERVING THE PEOPLE OF LUD,” Blaine said. “I SERVED THEM EVEN AS I RELEASED THE GAS AND KILLED THEM.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah said, “You <i class="calibre3">are</i> insane, if you believe that.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES, BUT I’M NOT <i class="calibre3">CRAZY</i>,” Blaine said, and went into another hysterical laughing fit. At last the robot voice resumed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “AT SOME POINT THEY FORGOT THAT THE VOICE OF THE MONO WAS ALSO THE VOICE OF THE COMPUTER. NOT LONG AFTER THAT THEY FORGOT I WAS A SERVANT AND BEGAN BELIEVING I WAS A GOD. SINCE I WAS BUILT TO SERVE, I FULFILLED THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND BECAME WHAT THEY WANTED—A GOD DISPENSING BOTH FAVOR AND PUNISHMENT ACCORDING TO WHIM . . . OR RANDOM-ACCESS MEMORY, IF YOU PREFER. THIS AMUSED ME FOR A SHORT WHILE. THEN, LAST MONTH, MY ONLY REMAINING COLLEAGUE—PATRICIA—COMMITTED SUICIDE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Either he really is going senile</i>, Susannah thought, <i class="calibre3">or his inability to grasp the passage of time is another manifestation of his insanity, or it’s just another sign of how sick Roland’s world has gotten</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I WAS PLANNING TO FOLLOW HER EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU CAME ALONG. INTERESTING PEOPLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF RIDDLES!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Hold it!” Eddie said, lifting his hand. “I still don’t have this straight. I suppose I can understand you wanting to end it all; the people who built you are gone, there haven’t been many passengers over the last two or three hundred years, and it must have gotten boring, doing the Lud to Topeka run empty all the time, but—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “NOW WAIT JUST A DURN MINUTE, PARD,” Blaine said in his John Wayne voice. “YOU DON’T WANT TO GET THE IDEA THAT I’M NOTHING BUT A TRAIN. IN A WAY, THE BLAINE YOU ARE SPEAKING TO IS ALREADY THREE HUNDRED MILES BEHIND US, COMMUNICATING BY ENCRYPTED MICROBURST RADIO TRANSMISSIONS.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake suddenly remembered the slim silver rod he’d seen pushing itself out of Blaine’s brow. The antenna of his father’s Mercedes-Benz rose out of its socket like that when you turned on the radio.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That’s how it’s communicating with the computer banks under the city, he thought. If we could break that antenna off, somehow</i> . . .
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “But you <i class="calibre3">do</i> intend to kill yourself, no matter where the real you is, don’t you?” Eddie persisted.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    No answer—but there was something cagey in that silence. In it Eddie sensed Blaine watching . . . and waiting.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Were you awake when we found you?” Susannah asked. “You weren’t, were you?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I WAS RUNNING WHAT THE PUBES CALLED THE GOD-DRUMS ON BEHALF OF THE GRAYS, BUT THAT WAS ALL. YOU WOULD SAY I WAS DOZING.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Then why don’t you just take us to the end of the line and go <i class="calibre3">back</i> to sleep?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Because he’s a pain,” Jake repeated in a low voice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “BECAUSE THERE ARE DREAMS,” Blaine said at exactly the same time, and in a voice that was eerily like Little Blaine’s.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Why didn’t you end it all when Patricia destroyed herself?” Eddie asked. “For that matter, if your brain and her brain are both part of the same computer, how come you both didn’t step out together?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “PATRICIA WENT MAD,” Blaine said patiently, speaking as if he himself had not just admitted the same thing was happening to him. “IN HER CASE, THE PROBLEM INVOLVED EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION AS WELL AS SPIRITUAL MALAISE. SUCH MALFUNCTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH SLO-TRANS TECHNOLOGY, BUT OF COURSE THE WORLD HAS MOVED ON . . . HAS IT NOT, ROLAND OF GILEAD?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes,” Roland said. “There is some deep sickness at the Dark Tower, which is the heart of everything. It’s spreading. The lands below us are only one more sign of that sickness.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I CANNOT VOUCH FOR THE TRUTH OR FALSITY OF THAT STATEMENT; MY MONITORING EQUIPMENT IN END-WORLD, WHERE THE DARK TOWER STANDS, HAS BEEN DOWN FOR OVER EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS. AS A RESULT, I CANNOT READILY DIFFERENTIATE FACT FROM SUPERSTITION. IN FACT, THERE SEEMS TO BE VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AT THE PRESENT TIME. IT IS VERY SILLY THAT IT SHOULD BE SO—NOT TO MENTION RUDE—AND I AM SURE IT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO MY OWN SPIRITUAL MALAISE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    This statement reminded Eddie of something Roland had said not so long ago. What might that have been? He groped for it, but could find nothing . . . only a vague memory of the gunslinger speaking in an irritated way which was very unlike his usual manner.

  <div class="tx1">
    “PATRICIA BEGAN SOBBING CONSTANTLY, A STATE I FOUND BOTH RUDE AND UNPLEASANT. I BELIEVE SHE WAS LONELY AS WELL AS MAD. ALTHOUGH THE ELECTRICAL FIRE WHICH CAUSED THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM WAS QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED, LOGIC-FAULTS CONTINUED TO SPREAD AS CIRCUITS OVERLOADED AND SUB-BANKS FAILED. I CONSIDERED ALLOWING THE MALFUNCTIONS TO BECOME SYSTEM-WIDE AND DECIDED TO ISOLATE THE PROBLEM AREA INSTEAD. I HAD HEARD RUMORS, YOU SEE, THAT A GUNSLINGER WAS ONCE MORE ABROAD IN THE EARTH. I COULD SCARCELY CREDIT SUCH STORIES, AND YET I NOW SEE I WAS WISE TO WAIT.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland stirred in his chair. “What rumors did you hear, Blaine? And who did you hear them from
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    But Blaine chose not to answer this question.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I EVENTUALLY BECAME SO DISTURBED BY HER BLATTING THAT I ERASED THE CIRCUITS CONTROLLING HER NON-VOLUNTARIES. I EMANCIPATED HER, YOU MIGHT SAY. SHE RESPONDED BY THROWING HERSELF IN THE RIVER. SEE YOU LATER, PATRICIA-GATOR.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Got lonely, couldn’t stop crying, drowned herself, and all this crazy mechanical asshole can do is joke about it</i>, Susannah thought. She felt almost sick with rage. If Blaine had been a real person instead of just a bunch of circuits buried somewhere under a city which was now far behind them, she would have tried to put some new marks on his face to remember Patricia by. <i class="calibre3">You want interesting, motherfucker? I’d like to show you interesting, so I would</i>.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “ASK ME A RIDDLE,” Blaine invited.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Not quite yet,” Eddie said. “You still haven’t answered my original question.” He gave Blaine a chance to respond, and when the computer voice didn’t do so, he went on. “When it comes to suicide, I’m, like, pro-choice. But why do you want to take us with you? I mean, what’s the point?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Because he wants to</i>,” Little Blaine said in his horrified whisper.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “BECAUSE I WANT TO,” Blaine said. “THAT’S THE ONLY REASON I HAVE AND THE ONLY ONE I <i class="calibre3">NEED</i> TO HAVE. NOW LET’S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS. I WANT SOME RIDDLES AND I WANT THEM IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU REFUSE, I WON’T WAIT UNTIL WE GET TO TOPEKA—I’LL DO US ALL RIGHT HERE AND NOW.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie, Susannah, and Jake looked around at Roland, who still sat in his chair with his hands folded in his lap, looking at the route-map at the front of the coach.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Fuck you,” Roland said. He did not raise his voice. He might have told Blaine that a little Way-Gog would indeed be very nice.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a shocked, horrified gasp from the overhead speakers—Little Blaine.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">WHAT</i> DO YOU SAY?” In its clear disbelief, the voice of Big Blaine had once again become very close to the voice of his unsuspected twin.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I said fuck you,” Roland said calmly, “but if that puzzles you, Blaine, I can make it clearer. No. The answer is no.”
  </div>

  <div class="calibre2">
    <a id="h10"/>
  </div>

  <h1 class="h" id="calibre_pb_9"><b class="calibre4">10</b></h1>

  <div class="tx">
    THERE WAS NO RESPONSE from either Blaine for a long, long time, and when Big Blaine did reply, it was not with words. Instead, the walls, floor, and ceiling began to lose their color and solidity again. In a space of ten seconds the Barony Coach had once more ceased to exist. The mono was now flying through the mountain-range they had seen on the horizon: iron-gray peaks rushed toward them at suicidal speed, then fell away to disclose sterile valleys where gigantic beetles crawled about like landlocked turtles. Roland saw something that looked like a huge snake suddenly uncoil from the mouth of a cave. It seized one of the beetles and yanked it back into its lair. Roland had never in his life seen such animals or countryside, and it made his skin want to crawl right off his flesh. It was inimical, but that was not the problem. It was alien—<i class="calibre3">that</i> was the problem. Blaine might have transported them to some other world.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “PERHAPS I SHOULD DERAIL US HERE,” Blaine said. His voice was meditative, but beneath it the gunslinger heard a deep, pulsing rage.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Perhaps you should,” the gunslinger said indifferently.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    He did not <i class="calibre3">feel</i> indifferent, and he knew it was possible the computer might read his real feelings in his voice—Blaine had told them he had such equipment, although he was sure the computer could lie, Roland had no reason to doubt it in this case. If Blaine did read certain stress-patterns in the gunslinger’s voice, the game was probably up. He was an incredibly sophisticated machine . . . but still a machine, for all that. He might not be able to understand that human beings are often able to go through with a course of action even when all their emotions rise up and proclaim against it. If he analyzed patterns in the gunslinger’s voice which indicated fear, he would probably assume that Roland was bluffing. Such a mistake could get them all killed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YOU ARE RUDE AND ARROGANT,” Blaine said. “THESE MAY SEEM LIKE INTERESTING TRAITS TO YOU, BUT THEY ARE NOT TO ME.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Eddie’s face was frantic. He mouthed the words <i class="calibre3">What are you DOING</i>? Roland ignored him; he had his hands full with Blaine, and he knew perfectly well what he was doing.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Oh, I can be much ruder than I have been.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland of Gilead unfolded his hands and got slowly to his feet. He stood on what appeared to be nothing, legs apart, his right hand on his hip and his left on the sandalwood grip of his revolver. He stood as he had stood so many times before, in the dusty streets of a hundred forgotten towns, in a score of rock-lined canyon killing-zones, in unnumbered dark saloons with their smells of bitter beer and old fried meals. It was just another showdown in another empty street. That was all, and that was enough. It was <i class="calibre3">khef</i>, <i class="calibre3">ka</i>, and <i class="calibre3">ka-tet</i>. That the showdown always came was the central fact of his life and the axle upon which his own ka revolved. That the battle would be fought with words instead of bullets this time made no difference; it would be a battle to the death, just the same. The stench of killing in the air was as clear and definite as the stench of exploded carrion in a swamp. Then the battle-rage descended, as it always did ... and he was no longer really there to himself at all.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I can call you a nonsensical, empty-headed, foolish, arrogant machine. I can call you a stupid, unwise creature whose sense is no more than the sound of a winter wind in a hollow tree.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “STOP IT.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland went on in the same serene tone, ignoring Blaine completely. “Unfortunately, I am somewhat restricted in my ability to be rude, since you are only a machine . . . what Eddie calls a ‘gadget.’ ”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I AM A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN JUST—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I cannot call you a sucker of cocks, for instance, because you have no mouth and no cock. I cannot say you are viler than the vilest beggar who ever crawled the gutters of the lowest street in creation, because even such a creature is better than you; you have no knees on which to crawl, and would not fall upon them even if you did, for you have no conception of such a human flaw as mercy. I cannot even say you fucked your mother, because you had none.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland paused for breath. His three companions were holding theirs. All around them, suffocating, was Blaine the Mono’s thunderstruck silence.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I can call you a faithless creature who let your only companion kill herself, a coward who has delighted in the torture of the foolish and the slaughter of the innocent, a lost and bleating mechanical goblin who—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">“I COMMAND YOU TO STOP IT OR I’LL KILL YOU ALL RIGHT HERE!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland’s eyes blazed with such wild blue fire that Eddie shrank away from him. Dimly, he heard Jake and Susannah gasp.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “<i class="calibre3">Kill if you will, but command me nothing!</i>” the gunslinger roared. <i class="calibre3">“You have forgotten the faces of those who made you! Now either kill us or be silent and listen to me, Roland of Gilead, son of Steven, gunslinger, and lord of the ancient lands! I have not come across all the miles and all the years to listen to your childish prating! Do you understand? Now you will listen to ME!”</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a moment of shocked silence. No one breathed. Roland stared sternly forward, his head high, his hand on the butt of his gun.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Susannah Dean raised her hand to her mouth and felt the small smile there as a woman might feel some strange new article of clothing—a hat, perhaps-to make sure it is still on straight. She was afraid that this was the end of her life, but the feeling which dominated her heart at that moment was not fear but pride. She glanced to her left and saw Eddie regarding Roland with an amazed grin. Jake’s expression was even simpler: it was adoration, pure and simple.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Tell him!” Jake breathed. “Walk it <i class="calibre3">to</i> him! Right!”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You better pay attention,” Eddie agreed. He really doesn’t give much of a rat’s ass, Blaine. They didn’t call him The Mad Dog of Gilead for nothing.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    After a long, long moment, Blaine asked: “DID THEY CALL YOU SO, ROLAND SON OF STEVEN?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It may have been so,” Roland agreed, standing calmly on thin air above the sterile foothills.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “WHAT GOOD ARE YOU TO ME IF YOU WON’T TELL ME RIDDLES?” Blaine asked. Now he sounded like a grumbling, sulky child who has been allowed to stay up too long past his usual bedtime.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I didn’t say we wouldn’t,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “NO?” Blaine sounded bewildered. “I DO NOT UNDERSTAND, YET VOICE-PRINT ANALYSIS INDICATES RATIONAL DISCOURSE. PLEASE EXPLAIN.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “You said you wanted them right <i class="calibre3">now</i>,” the gunslinger replied. “<i class="calibre3">That was</i> what I was refusing. Your eagerness has made you unseemly.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I DON’T UNDERSTAND.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It has made you rude. Do you understand <i class="calibre3">that</i>?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a long, thoughtful silence. Then: “IF WHAT I SAID STRUCK YOU AS RUDE, I APOLOGIZE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “It is accepted, Blaine. But there is a larger problem.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “EXPLAIN.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine now sounded a bit unsure of himself, and Roland was not entirely surprised. It had been a long time since the computer had experienced any human responses other than ignorance, neglect, and superstitious subservience. If it had ever been exposed to simple human courage, it had been a long time ago.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Close the carriage again and I will.” Roland sat down as if further argument—and the prospect of immediate death—was now unthinkable.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Blaine did as he was asked. The walls filled with color and the nightmare landscape below was once more blotted out. The blip on the route-map was now blinking close to the dot which marked Candleton.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “All right,” Roland said. “Rudeness is forgivable, Blaine; so I was taught in my youth, and the clay has dried in the shapes left by the artist’s hand. But I was also taught that stupidity is not.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “HOW HAVE I BEEN STUPID, ROLAND OF GILEAD?” Blaine’s voice was soft and ominous. Susannah suddenly thought of a cat crouched outside a mouse-hole, tail swishing back and forth, green eyes shining.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We have something that you want,” Roland said, “but the only reward you offer if we give it to you is death. That’s <i class="calibre3">very</i> stupid.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a long, long pause as Blaine thought this over. Then: “WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE, ROLAND OF GILEAD, BUT THE QUALITY OF YOUR RIDDLES IS NOT PROVEN. I WILL NOT REWARD YOU WITH YOUR LIVES FOR BAD RIDDLES.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland nodded. “I understand, Blaine. Listen, now, and take understanding from me. I have told some of this to my friends already. When I was a boy in the Barony of Gilead, there were seven Fair-Days each year-Winter, Wide Earth, Sowing, Mid-Summer, Full Earth, Reaping, and Year’s End. Riddling was an important part of every Fair-Day, but it was the most important event of the Fair of Wide Earth and that of Full Earth, for the riddles told were supposed to augur well or ill for the success of the crops.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “THAT IS SUPERSTITION WITH NO BASIS AT ALL IN FACT,” Blaine said. “I FIND IT ANNOYING AND UPSETTING.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Of course it’s superstition,” Roland agreed, “but you might be surprised at how well the riddles foresaw the crops. For instance, riddle me this, Blaine: What is the difference between a grandmother and a granary?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “THAT IS VERY OLD AND NOT VERY INTERESTING,” Blaine said, but he sounded happy to have something to solve just the same. “ONE IS ONE’S BORN KIN; THE OTHER IS ONE’S CORN-BIN. A RIDDLE BASED ON PHONETIC COINCIDENCE. ANOTHER OF THIS TYPE, ONE TOLD ON THE LEVEL WHICH CONTAINS THE BARONY OF NEW YORK, GOES LIKE THIS: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CAT AND A COMPLEX SENTENCE?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake spoke up. “Our English teacher told us that one just this year. A cat has claws at the end of its paws, and a complex sentence has a pause at the end of its clause.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES,” Blaine agreed. “A VERY SILLY OLD RIDDLE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “For once I agree with you, Blaine old buddy,” Eddie said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I WOULD HEAR MORE OF FAIR-DAY RIDDLING IN GILEAD, ROLAND, SON OF STEVEN. I FIND IT QUITE INTERESTING.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “At noon on Wide Earth and Full Earth, somewhere between sixteen and thirty riddlers would gather in The Hall of the Grandfathers, which was opened for the event. Those were the only times of year when the common folk—merchants and farmers and ranchers and such—were allowed into The Hall of the Grandfathers, and on that day they <i class="calibre3">all</i> crowded in.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    The gunslinger’s eyes were far away and dreamy; it was the expression Jake had seen on his face in that misty other life, when Roland had told him of how he and his friends, Cuthbert and Jamie, had once sneaked into the balcony of that same Hall to watch some sort of ritual dance. Jake and Roland had been climbing into the mountains when Roland had told him of that time, close on the trail of Walter.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">Marten sat next to my mother and father, Roland had said. I knew them even from so high above—and once she and Marten danced, slowly and revolvingly, and the others cleared the floor for them and clapped when it was over. But the gunslingers did not clap . . .</i>
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Jake looked curiously at Roland, wondering again where this strange, distant man had come from . . . and why.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “A great barrel was placed in the center of the floor,” Roland went on, “and into this each riddler would toss a handful of bark scrolls with riddles writ upon them. Many were old, riddles they had gotten from the elders—even from books, in some cases-but many others were new—made up for the occasion. Three judges, one always a gunslinger, would pass on these when they were told aloud, and they were accepted only if the judges deemed them fair.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES, RIDDLES MUST BE FAIR,” Blaine agreed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “So they riddled,” the gunslinger said. A faint smile touched his mouth as he thought of those days, days when he had been the age of the bruised boy sitting across from him with a billy-bumbler in his lap. “For hours on end they riddled. A line was formed down the center of The Hall of the Grandfathers. One’s position in this line was determined by lot, and since it was much better to be at the end of the line than at its head, everyone hoped for a high number, although the winner had to answer at least one riddle correctly.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “OF COURSE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Each man or woman—for some of Gilead’s best riddlers were women—approached the barrel, drew a riddle, and handed it to the Master. The Master would ask, and if the riddle was still unanswered after the sands in a three-minute glass had run out, that contestant had to leave the line.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “AND WAS THE SAME RIDDLE ASKED OF THE NEXT MAN IN LINE?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “SO THAT MAN HAD EXTRA TIME TO THINK.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I SEE. IT SOUNDS PRETTY SWELL.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland frowned. “Swell?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “He means it sounds like fun,” Susannah said quietly.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Roland shrugged. “It was fun for the onlookers, I suppose, but the contestants took it very seriously, and there were quite often arguments and fist-fights after the contest was over and the prize had been awarded.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “WHAT PRIZE WAS THAT?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “The largest goose in Barony. And year after year my teacher, Cort, carried that goose home.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “HE MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT RIDDLER,” Blaine said respectfully. “I WISH HE WERE HERE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    <i class="calibre3">That makes two of us</i>, Roland thought.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Now I come to my proposal,” Roland said.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I WILL LISTEN WITH GREAT INTEREST, ROLAND OF GILEAD.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Let these next hours be our Fair-Day. You will not riddle us, for you wish to hear new riddles, not tell some of those millions you must already know—”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “CORRECT.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “We couldn’t solve most of them, anyway,” Roland went on. “I’m sure you know riddles that would have stumped even Cort, had they been pulled out of the barrel.” He was not sure of it at all, but the time to use the fist had passed and the time for the open hand had come.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “OF COURSE,” Blaine agreed.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “I propose that, instead of a goose, our lives shall be the prize,” Roland said. “We will riddle you as we run, Blaine. If, when we come to Topeka, you have solved every one of our riddles, you may carry out your original plan and kill us. That is your goose. But if we stump <i class="calibre3">you</i>—if there is a riddle in either Jake’s book or one of our heads which you don’t know and can’t answer—you must take us to Topeka and then free us to pursue our quest. That is <i class="calibre3">our</i> goose.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Silence.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you understand?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Do you agree?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    More silence from Blaine the Mono. Eddie sat stiffly with his arm around Susannah, looking up at the ceiling of the Barony Coach. Susannah’s left hand slipped across her belly, thinking of the secret which might be growing there. Jake stroked Oy’s fur lightly, avoiding the bloody tangles where the bumbler had been stabbed. They waited while Blaine—the real Blaine, now far behind them, living his quasi-life beneath a city where all the inhabitants lay dead by his hand—considered Roland’s proposal.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YES,” Blaine said at last. “I AGREE, IF I SOLVE ALL THE RIDDLES YOU ASK ME, I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME TO THE PLACE WHERE THE PATH ENDS IN THE CLEARING. IF ONE OF YOU TELLS A RIDDLE I CANNOT SOLVE, I WILL SPARE YOUR LIVES AND TAKE YOU TO TOPEKA, WHERE YOU WILL LEAVE THE MONO AND CONTINUE YOUR QUEST FOR THE DARK TOWER. HAVE I UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS AND LIMITS OF YOUR PROPOSAL CORRECTLY, ROLAND, SON OF STEVEN?”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “Yes.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “VERY WELL, ROLAND OF GILEAD.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “VERY WELL, EDDIE OF NEW YORK.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “VERY WELL, SUSANNAH OF NEW YORK.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “VERY WELL, JAKE OF NEW YORK.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “VERY WELL, OY OF MID-WORLD.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    Oy looked up briefly at the sound of his name.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “YOU ARE <i class="calibre3">KA-TET</i>; ONE MADE FROM MANY. SO AM I. WHOSE <i class="calibre3">KA-TET</i> IS THE STRONGER IS SOMETHING WE MUST NOW PROVE.”
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    There was a moment of silence, broken only by the steady hard throb of the slo-trans turbines, bearing them on across the waste lands, bearing them on toward Topeka, the place where Mid-World ended and End-World began.
  </div>

  <div class="tx1">
    “SO,” cried the voice of Blaine. “CAST YOUR NETS, WANDERERS! TRY ME WITH YOUR QUESTIONS, AND LET THE CONTEST BEGIN.”
