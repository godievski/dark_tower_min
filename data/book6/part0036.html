  <p class="noindent">I’d once more like to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of Robin Furth, who read this novel in manuscript—and those preceding it—with great and sympathetic attention to detail. If this increasingly complex tale hangs together, Robin should get most of the credit. And if you don’t believe it, check out her <span class="txit">Dark Tower</span> concordance, which makes fascinating reading in and of itself.</p>

  <p class="noindenta">Thanks are also due to Chuck Verrill, who has edited the final five novels in the Tower cycle, and to the three publishers, two large and one small, who cooperated to make this massive project a reality: Robert Wiener (Donald M. Grant, Publisher), Susan Petersen Kennedy and Pamela Dorman (Viking), Susan Moldow and Nan Graham (Scribner). Special thanks to Agent Moldow, whose irony and bravery have saved many a bleak day. There are others, plenty of them, but I’m not going to annoy you with the whole list. After all, this ain’t the fucking Academy Awards, is it?</p>

  <p class="noindenta"><a id="page_544"></a>Certain geographical details in this book and in the concluding novel of the Tower cycle have been fictionalized. The real people mentioned in these pages have been used in a fictional way. And to the best of my knowledge, there were never coin-op storage lockers in the World Trade Center.</p>

  <p class="noindenta">As for you, Constant Reader . . .</p>

  <p class="noindenta">One more turn of the path, and then we reach the clearing.</p>

  <p class="noindenta">Come along with me, will ya not?</p>
