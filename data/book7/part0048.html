  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">ONE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">The road and the tale have both been long, would you not say so? The trip has been long and the cost has been high . . . but no great thing was ever attained easily. A long tale, like a tall Tower, must be built a stone at a time. Now, however, as the end draws closer, you must mark yon two travelers walking toward us with great care. The older man—he with the tanned, lined face and the gun on his hip—is pulling the cart they call Ho Fat II. The younger one—he with the oversized drawing pad tucked under his arm that makes him look like a student in days of old—is walking along beside it. They are climbing a long, gently upsloping hill not much different from hundreds of others they have climbed. The overgrown road they follow is lined on either side with the remains of rock walls; wild roses grow in amiable profusion amid the tumbles of fieldstone. In the open, brush-dotted land beyond these fallen walls are strange stone edifices. Some look like the ruins of castles; others have the appearance of Egyptian obelisks; a few are clearly Speaking Rings of the sort where <a id="page_966"></a> demons may be summoned; one ancient ruin of stone pillars and plinths has the look of Stonehenge. One almost expects to see hooded Druids gathered in the center of that great circle, perhaps casting the runes, but the keepers of these monuments, these precursors of the Great Monument, are all gone. Only small herds of bannock graze where once they worshipped.</p>

  <p class="indent">Never mind. It’s not old ruins we’ve come to observe near the end of our long journey, but the old gunslinger pulling the handles of the cart. We stand at the crest of the hill and wait as he comes toward us. He comes. And comes. Relentless as ever, a man who always learns to speak the language of the land (at least some of it) and the customs of the country; he is still a man who would straighten pictures in strange hotel rooms. Much about him has changed, but not that. He crests the hill, so close to us now that we can smell the sour tang of his sweat. He looks up, a quick and automatic glance he shoots first ahead and then to either side as he tops any hill—<span class="txitc">Always con yer vantage</span> was Cort’s rule, and the last of his pupils has still not forgotten it. He looks up without interest, looks down . . . and stops. After a moment of staring at the broken, weed-infested paving of the road, he looks up again, more slowly this time. Much more slowly. As if in dread of what he thinks he has seen.</p>

  <p class="indentb">And it’s here we must join him—sink into him—although how we will ever con the vantage of Roland’s heart at such a moment as this, when the single-minded goal of his lifetime at last comes in sight, is more than this poor excuse for a storyman can ever tell. Some moments are beyond imagination.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2"><a id="page_967"></a>TWO</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Roland glanced up quickly as he topped the hill, not because he expected trouble but because the habit was too deeply ingrained to break. <span class="txitc">Always con yer vantage,</span> Cort had told them, drilling it into their heads from the time when they had been little more than babbies. He looked back down at the road—it was becoming more and more difficult to swerve among the roses without crushing any, although he had managed the trick so far—and then, belatedly, realized what he had just seen.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">What you</span> thought <span class="txitc">you saw,</span> Roland told himself, still looking down at the road. <span class="txitc">It’s probably just another of the strange ruins we’ve been passing ever since we started moving again.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">But even then Roland knew it wasn’t so. What he’d seen was not to either side of the Tower Road, but dead ahead.</p>

  <p class="indent">He looked up again, hearing his neck creak like hinges in an old door, and there, still miles ahead but now visible on the horizon, real as roses, was the top of the Dark Tower. That which he had seen in a thousand dreams he now saw with his living eyes. Sixty or eighty yards ahead, the road rose to a higher hill with an ancient Speaking Ring moldering in the ivy and honeysuckle on one side and a grove of ironwood trees on the other. At the center of this near horizon, the black shape rose in the near distance, blotting out a tiny portion of the blue sky.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick came to a stop beside Roland and made one of his hooting sounds.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Do you see it?” Roland asked. His voice was dusty, cracked with amazement. Then, before <a id="page_968"></a> Patrick could answer, the gunslinger pointed to what the boy wore around his neck. In the end, the binoculars had been the only item in Mordred’s little bit of gunna worth taking.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Give them over, Pat.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick did, willingly enough. Roland raised them to his eyes, made a minute adjustment to the knurled focus knob, and then caught his breath as the top of the Tower sprang into view, seemingly close enough to touch. How much was visible over the horizon? How much was he looking at? Twenty feet? Perhaps as much as fifty? He didn’t know, but he could see at least three of the narrow slit-windows which ascended the Tower’s barrel in a spiral, and he could see the oriel window at the top, its many colors blazing in the spring sunshine, the black center seeming to peer back down the binoculars at him like the very Eye of Todash.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick hooted and held out a hand for the binoculars. He wanted his own look, and Roland handed the glasses over without a murmur. He felt light-headed, not really there. It occurred to him that he had sometimes felt like that in the weeks before his battle with Cort, as though he were a dream or a moonbeam. He had sensed something coming, some vast change, and that was what he felt now.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Yonder it is,</span> he thought. <span class="txitc">Yonder is my destiny, the end of my life’s road. And yet my heart still beats (a little faster than before, ’tis true), my blood still courses, and no doubt when I bend over to grasp the handles of this becurst cart my back will groan and I may pass a little gas. Nothing at all has changed.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">He waited for the disappointment this thought surely presaged—the letdown. It didn’t come. What he felt instead was a queer, soaring brightness <a id="page_969"></a>that seemed to begin in his mind and then spread to his muscles. For the first time since setting out at mid-morning, thoughts of Oy and Susannah left his mind. He felt free.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick lowered the binoculars. When he turned to Roland, his face was excited. He pointed to the black thumb jutting above the horizon and hooted.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” Roland said. “Someday, in some world, some version of you will paint it, along with Llamrei, Arthur Eld’s horse. That I know, for I’ve seen the proof. As for now, it’s where we must go.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick hooted again, then pulled a long face. He put his hands to his temples and swayed his head back and forth, like someone who has a terrible headache.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” Roland said. “I’m afraid, too. But there’s no help for it. I have to go there. Would you stay here, Patrick? Stay and wait for me? If you would, I give you leave to do so.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick shook his head at once. And, just in case Roland didn’t take the point, the mute boy seized his arm in a hard grip. The right hand, the one with which he drew, was like iron.</p>

  <p class="indentb">Roland nodded. Even tried to smile. “Yes,” he said, “that’s fine. Stay with me as long as you like. As long as you understand that in the end I’ll have to go on alone.”</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">THREE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Now, as they rose from each dip and topped each hill, the Dark Tower seemed to spring closer. More of the spiraling windows which ran around its great circumference became visible. Roland could see <a id="page_970"></a> two steel posts jutting from the top. The clouds which followed the Paths of the two working Beams seemed to flow away from the tips, making a great <span class="txitc">X</span>-shape in the sky. The voices grew louder, and Roland realized they were singing the names of the world. Of <span class="txitc">all</span> the worlds. He didn’t know how he could know that, but he was sure of it. That lightness of being continued to fill him up. Finally, as they crested a hill with great stone men marching away to the north on their left (the remains of their faces, painted in some blood-red stuff, glared down upon them), Roland told Patrick to climb up into the cart. Patrick looked surprised. He made a series of hooting noises Roland took to mean <span class="txitc">But aren’t you tired?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes, but I need an anchor, even so. Without one I’m apt to start running toward yonder Tower, even though part of me knows better. And if plain old exhaustion doesn’t burst my heart, the Red King’s apt to take my head off with one of his toys. Get in, Patrick.”</p>

  <p class="indentb">Patrick did so. He rode sitting hunched forward, with the binoculars pressed against his eyes.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">FOUR</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Three hours later, they came to the foot of a much steeper hill. It was, Roland’s heart told him, the last hill. Can’-Ka No Rey was beyond. At the top, on the right, was a cairn of boulders that had once been a small pyramid. What remained stood about thirty feet high. Roses grew around its base in a rough crimson ring. Roland set this in his sights and took the hill slowly, pulling the cart by its handles. As he climbed, the top of the Dark Tower once more appeared. <a id="page_971"></a>Each step brought a greater length of it into view. Now he could see the balconies with their waist-high railings. There was no need of the binoculars; the air was preternaturally clear. He put the distance remaining at no more than five miles. Perhaps only three. Level after level rose before his not-quite-disbelieving eye.</p>

  <p class="indent">Just shy of this hill’s top, with the crumbling rock pyramid twenty paces ahead of them on the right, Roland stopped, bent, and set the handles of the cart on the road for the last time. Every nerve in his body spoke of danger.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Patrick? Hop down.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick did so, looking anxiously into Roland’s face and hooting.</p>

  <p class="indent">The gunslinger shook his head. “I can’t say why just yet. Only it’s not safe.” The voices sang in a great chorus, but the air around them was still. Not a bird soared overhead or sang in the distance. The wandering herds of bannock had all been left behind. A breeze soughed around them, and the grasses rippled. The roses nodded their wild heads.</p>

  <p class="indent">The two of them walked on together, and as they did, Roland felt a timid touch against the side of his two-fingered right hand. He looked at Patrick. The mute boy looked anxiously back, trying to smile. Roland took his hand, and they crested the hill in that fashion.</p>

  <p class="indent">Below them was a great blanket of red that stretched to the horizon in every direction. The road cut through it, a dusty white line perfectly straight and perhaps twelve feet wide. In the middle of the rose-field stood the sooty dark gray Tower, just as it had stood in his dreams; its windows gleamed in the sun. Here the road split and <a id="page_972"></a> made a perfect white circle around the Tower’s base to continue on the other side, in a direction Roland believed was now dead east instead of south-by-east. Another road ran off at right angles to the Tower Road: to the north and south, if he was right in believing that the points of the compass had been re-established. From above, the Dark Tower would look like the center of a blood-filled gunsight.</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s—” Roland began, and then a great, crazed shriek floated to them on the breeze, weirdly undiminished by the distance of miles. <span class="txitc">It comes on the Beam,</span> Roland thought. <span class="txitc">And it’s carried by the roses.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“GUNSLINGER!”</span> screamed the Crimson King. <span class="txitc">“NOW YOU DIE!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">There was a whistling sound, thin at first and then growing, cutting through the combined song of the Tower and the roses like the keenest blade ever ground on a wheel dusted with diamonds. Patrick stood transfixed, peering dumbly at the Tower; he would have been blown out of his boots if not for Roland, whose reflexes were as quick as ever. He pulled the mute boy behind the heaped stone of the pyramid by their joined hands. There were other stones hidden in the high grass of dock and jimson; they stumbled over these and went sprawling. Roland felt the corner of one digging painfully into his ribs.</p>

  <p class="indent">The whistle continued to rise, becoming an earsplitting whine. Roland saw a golden something flash past in the air—one of the sneetches. It struck the cart and it blew up, scattering their gunna every which way. Most of the stuff settled back to the road, cans rattling and bouncing, some of them burst.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_973"></a>Then came high, chattering laughter that set Roland’s teeth on edge; beside him, Patrick covered his ears. The lunacy in that laughter was almost unbearable.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“COME OUT!”</span> urged that distant, mad, laughing voice. <span class="txitc">“COME OUT AND PLAY, ROLAND! COME TO ME! COME TO YOUR TOWER, AFTER ALL THE LONG YEARS WILL YOU NOT?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick looked at him, his eyes desperate and frightened. He was holding his drawing pad against his chest like a shield.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland peered carefully around the edge of the pyramid, and there, on a balcony two levels up from the Tower’s base, he saw exactly what he had seen in sai Sayre’s painting: one blob of red and three blobs of white; a face and two upraised hands. But this was no painting, and one of the hands moved rapidly forward in a throwing gesture and there came another hellish, rising whine. Roland rolled back against the tumble of the pyramid. There was a pause that seemed endless, and then the sneetch struck the pyramid’s other side and exploded. The concussion threw them forward onto their faces. Patrick screamed in terror. Rocks flew to either side in a spray. Some of them rattled down on the road, but Roland saw not a single piece of shrapnel strike so much as a single rose.</p>

  <p class="indent">The boy scrambled to his knees and would have run—likely back into the road—but Roland grabbed him by the collar of his hide coat and yanked him down again.</p>

  <p class="indent">“We’re safe enough here,” he murmured to Patrick. “Look.” He reached into a hole revealed by the falling rock, knocked on the interior with his knuckles, produced a dull ringing noise, and <a id="page_974"></a> showed his teeth in a strained grin. “Steel! Yar! He can hit this thing with a dozen of his flying fireballs and not knock it down. All he can do is blast away the rocks and blocks and expose what lies beneath. Kennit? And I don’t think he’ll waste his ammunition. He can’t have much more than a donkey’s carry.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Before Patrick could reply, Roland peered around the pyramid’s ragged edge once more. He cupped his hands around his mouth and screamed: <span class="txitc">“TRY AGAIN, SAI! WE’RE STILL HERE, BUT PERHAPS YOUR NEXT THROW WILL BE LUCKY!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">There was a moment of silence, then an insane scream: <span class="txitc">“EEEEEEEEEEE! YOU DON’T DARE MOCK ME! YOU DON’T DARE! EEEEEEEEEEE!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Now came another of those rising whistles. Roland grabbed Patrick and fell on top of him, behind the pyramid but not against it. He was afraid it might vibrate hard enough when the sneetch struck to give them concussion injuries, or turn their soft insides to jelly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Only this time the sneetch didn’t strike the pyramid. It flew past it instead, soaring above the road. Roland rolled off Patrick and onto his back. His eyes picked up the golden blur and marked the place where it buttonhooked back toward its targets. He shot it out of the air like a clay plate. There was a blinding flash and then it was gone.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“OH DEAR, STILL HERE!”</span> Roland called, striving to put just the right note of mocking amusement into his voice. It wasn’t easy when you were screaming at the top of your lungs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Another crazed scream in response—<span class="txitc">“EEEEEEEEE!”</span> Roland was amazed that the Red King didn’t split his own head wide open with such <a id="page_975"></a>cries. He reloaded the chamber he’d emptied—he intended to keep a full gun just as long as he could—and this time there was a double whine. Patrick moaned, rolled over onto his belly, and plunged his face into the rock-strewn grass, covering his head with his hands. Roland sat with his back against the pyramid of rock and steel, the long barrel of his sixgun lying on his thigh, relaxed and waiting. At the same time he bent all of his willpower toward one object. His eyes wanted water in response to that high, approaching whistle, and he must not let them. If he ever needed the preternaturally keen eyesight for which he’d been famous in his time, this was it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Those blue eyes were still clear when the sneetches bolted past above the road. This time one buttonhooked left and the other right. They took evasive action, jigging crazily first one way and then another. It made no difference. Roland waited, sitting with his legs outstretched and his old broken boots cocked into a relaxed V, his heart beating slow and steady, his eye filled with all the world’s clarity and color (had he seen better on that last day, he believed he would have been able to see the wind). Then he snapped his gun up, blew both sneetches out of the air, and was once more reloading the empty chambers while the afterimages still pulsed with his heartbeat in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p class="indent">He leaned to the corner of the pyramid, plucked up the binoculars, braced them on a convenient spur of rock, and looked through them for his enemy. The Crimson King almost jumped at him, and for once in his life Roland saw exactly what he had imagined: an old man with an enormous <a id="page_976"></a>nose, hooked and waxy; red lips that bloomed in the snow of a luxuriant beard; snowy hair that spilled down the Crimson King’s back almost all the way to his scrawny bottom. His pink-flushed face peered toward the pilgrims. The King wore a robe of brilliant red, dotted here and about with lightning strokes and cabalistic symbols. To Susannah, Eddie, and Jake, he would have looked like Father Christmas. To Roland he looked like what he was: Hell, incarnate.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“HOW SLOW YOU ARE!”</span> the gunslinger cried in a tone of mock amazement. <span class="txitc">“TRY THREE, PERHAPS THREE AT ONCE WILL DO YA!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Looking into the binoculars was like looking into a magic hourglass tipped on its side. Roland watched the Big Red King leaping up and down, shaking his hands beside his face in a way that was almost comic. Roland thought he could see a crate at that robed figure’s feet, but wasn’t entirely sure; the scrolled iron staves between the balcony’s floor and its railing obscured it.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Must be his ammunition supply,</span> he thought. Must <span class="txitc">be. How many can he have in a crate that size? Twenty? Fifty?</span> It didn’t matter. Unless the Red King could throw more than twelve at a time, Roland was confident he could shoot anything out of the air the old daemon sent his way. This was, after all, what he’d been made for.</p>

  <p class="indent">Unfortunately, the Crimson King knew it as well as Roland did.</p>

  <p class="indent">The thing on the balcony gave another gruesome, earsplitting cry (Patrick plugged his dirty ears with his dirty fingers) and made as if to dip down for fresh ammunition. Then, however, he stopped himself. Roland watched him advance to <a id="page_977"></a>the balcony’s railing . . . and then peer directly into the gunslinger’s eyes. That glare was red and burning. Roland lowered the binoculars at once, lest he be fascinated.</p>

  <p class="indent">The King’s call drifted to him. <span class="txitc">“WAIT THEN, A BIT</span>—<span class="txitc">AND MEDITATE ON WHAT YOU’D GAIN, ROLAND! THINK HOW CLOSE IT IS! AND . . . LISTEN! HEAR THE SONG YOUR DARLING SINGS!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">He fell silent then. No more whistling; no more whines; no more oncoming sneetches. What Roland heard instead was the sough of the wind . . . and what the King wanted him to hear.</p>

  <p class="indent">The call of the Tower.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Come, Roland,</span> sang the voices. They came from the roses of Can’-Ka No Rey, they came from the strengthening Beams overhead, they came most of all from the Tower itself, that for which he had searched all his life, that which was now in reach . . . that which was being held away from him, now, at the last. If he went to it, he would be killed in the open. Yet the call was like a fishhook in his mind, drawing him. The Crimson King knew it would do his work if he only waited. And as the time passed, Roland came to know it, too. Because the calling voices weren’t constant. At their current level he could withstand them. <span class="txitc">Was</span> withstanding them. But as the afternoon wore on, the level of the call grew stronger. He began to understand—and with growing horror—why in his dreams and visions he had always seen himself coming to the Dark Tower at sunset, when the light in the western sky seemed to reflect the field of roses, turning the whole world into a bucket of blood held up by one single stanchion, black as midnight against the burning horizon.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_978"></a>He had seen himself coming at sunset because that was when the Tower’s strengthening call would finally overcome his willpower. He would go. No power on Earth would be able to stop him.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Come . . . come . . .</span> became <span class="txitc">COME . . . COME . . .</span> and then <span class="txitc">COME! COME!</span> His head ached with it. And <span class="txitc">for</span> it. Again and again he found himself getting to his knees and forced himself to sit down once more with his back against the pyramid.</p>

  <p class="indentb">Patrick was staring at him with growing fright. He was partly or completely immune to that call—Roland understood this—but he knew what was happening.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">FIVE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">They had been pinned down for what Roland judged to be an hour when the King tried another pair of sneetches. This time they flew on either side of the pyramid and hooked back almost at once, coming at him in perfect formation but twenty feet apart. Roland took the one on the right, snapped his wrist to the left, and blew the other one out of the sky. The explosion of the second one was close enough to buffet his face with warm air, but at least there was no shrapnel; when they blew, they blew completely, it seemed.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“TRY AGAIN!”</span> he called. His throat was rough and dry now, but he knew the words were carrying—the air in this place was made for such communication. And he knew each one was a dagger pricking the old lunatic’s flesh. But he had his own problems. The call of the Tower was growing steadily stronger.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“COME, GUNSLINGER!”</span> the madman’s voice <a id="page_979"></a>coaxed. <span class="txitc">“PERHAPS I’LL LET THEE COME, AFTER ALL! WE COULD AT LEAST PALAVER ON THE SUBJECT, COULD WE NOT?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">To his horror, Roland thought he sensed a certain sincerity in that voice.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Yes,</span> he thought grimly. <span class="txitc">And we’ll have coffee. Perhaps even a little fry-up</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">He fumbled the watch out of his pocket and snapped it open. The hands were running briskly backward. He leaned against the pyramid and closed his eyes, but that was worse. The call of the Tower</p>

  <p class="indent">(<span class="txitc">come, Roland come, gunslinger, commala-come-come, now the journey’s done</span>)</p>

  <p class="indent">was louder, more insistent than ever. He opened them again and looked up at the unforgiving blue sky and the clouds that raced across it in columns to the Tower at the end of the rose-field.</p>

  <p class="indentb">And the torture continued.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">SIX</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">He hung on for another hour while the shadows of the bushes and the roses growing near the pyramid lengthened, hoping against hope that something would occur to him, some brilliant idea that would save him from having to put his life and his fate in the hands of the talented but soft-minded boy by his side. But as the sun began to slide down the western arc of the sky and the blue overhead began to darken, he knew there was nothing else. The hands of the pocket-watch were turning backward ever faster. Soon they would be spinning. And when they began to spin, he would go. Sneetches or no sneetches (and what else might the madman <a id="page_980"></a> be holding in reserve?), he would go. He would run, he would zig-zag, he would fall to the ground and crawl if he had to, and no matter what he did, he knew he would be lucky to make it even half the distance to the Dark Tower before he was blown out of his boots.</p>

  <p class="indent">He would die among the roses.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Patrick,” he said. His voice was husky.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick looked up at him with desperate intensity. Roland stared at the boy’s hands—dirty, scabbed, but in their way as incredibly talented as his own—and gave in. It occurred to him that he’d only held out as long as this from pride; he had wanted to kill the Crimson King, not merely send him into some null zone. And of course there was no guarantee that Patrick could do to the King what he’d done to the sore on Susannah’s face. But the pull of the Tower would soon be too strong to resist, and all his other choices were gone.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Change places with me, Patrick.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick did, scrambling carefully over Roland. He was now at the edge of the pyramid nearest the road.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Look through the far-seeing instrument. Lay it in that notch—yes, just so—and look.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick did, and for what seemed to Roland a very long time. The voice of the Tower, meanwhile, sang and chimed and cajoled. At long last, Patrick looked back at him.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Now take thy pad, Patrick. Draw yonder man.” Not that he <span class="txitc">was</span> a man, but at least he looked like one.</p>

  <p class="indent">At first, however, Patrick only continued to gaze at Roland, biting his lip. Then, at last, he took the sides of the gunslinger’s head in his hands and <a id="page_981"></a>brought it forward until they were brow to brow.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Very hard,</span> whispered a voice deep in Roland’s mind. It was not the voice of a boy at all, but of a grown man. A powerful man. <span class="txitc">He’s not entirely there. He darkles. He tincts.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Where had Roland heard those words before?</p>

  <p class="indent">No time to think about it now.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Are you saying you can’t?” Roland asked, injecting (with an effort) a note of disappointed incredulity into his voice. “That <span class="txitc">you</span> can’t? That <span class="txitc">Patrick</span> can’t? The <span class="txitc">Artist</span> can’t?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick’s eyes changed. For a moment Roland saw in them the expression that would be there permanently if he grew to be a man . . . and the paintings in Sayre’s office said that he would do that, at least on some track of time, in some world. Old enough, at least, to paint what he had seen this day. That expression would be hauteur, if he grew to be an old man with a little wisdom to match his talent; now it was only arrogance. The look of a kid who knows he’s faster than blue blazes, the best, and cares to know nothing else. Roland knew that look, for had he not seen it gazing back at him from a hundred mirrors and still pools of water when he had been as young as Patrick Danville was now?</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">I can,</span> came the voice in Roland’s head. <span class="txitc">I only say it won’t be easy. I’ll need the eraser</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland shook his head at once. In his pocket, his hand closed around what remained of the pink nubbin and held it tight.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No,” he said. “Thee must draw cold, Patrick. Every line right the first time. The erasing comes later.”</p>

  <p class="indent">For a moment the look of arrogance faltered, <a id="page_982"></a> but only for a moment. When it returned, what came with it pleased the gunslinger mightily, and eased him a little, as well. It was a look of hot excitement. It was the look the talented wear when, after years of just moving sleepily along from pillar to post, they are finally challenged to do something that will tax their abilities, stretch them to their limits. Perhaps even beyond them.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick rolled to the binoculars again, which he’d left propped aslant just below the notch. He looked long while the voices sang their growing imperative in Roland’s head.</p>

  <p class="indentb">And at last he rolled away, took up his pad, and began to draw the most important picture of his life.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">SEVEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">It was slow work compared to Patrick’s usual method—rapid strokes that produced a completed and compelling drawing in only minutes. Roland again and again had to restrain himself from shouting at the boy: <span class="txitc">Hurry up! For the sake of all the gods, hurry up! Can’t you see that I’m in agony here?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">But Patrick didn’t see and wouldn’t have cared in any case. He was totally absorbed in his work, caught up in the unknowing greed of it, pausing only to go back to the binoculars now and then for another long look at his red-robed subject. Sometimes he slanted the pencil to shade a little, then rubbed with his thumb to produce a shadow. Sometimes he rolled his eyes back in his head, showing the world nothing but the waxy gleam of the whites. It was as if he were conning some version of <a id="page_983"></a>the Red King that stood a-glow in his brain. And really, how did Roland know that was not possible?</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">I don’t care what it is. Just let him finish before I go mad and sprint to what the Old Red King so rightly called “my darling.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Half an hour at least three days long passed in this fashion. Once the Crimson King called more coaxingly than ever to Roland, asking if he would not come to the Tower and palaver, after all. Perhaps, he said, if Roland were to free him from his balcony prison, they might bury an arrow together and then climb to the top room of the Tower in that same spirit of friendliness. It was not impossible, after all. A hard rain made for queer bedfellows at the inn; had Roland never heard that saying?</p>

  <p class="indent">The gunslinger knew the saying well. He also knew that the Red King’s offer was essentially the same false request as before, only this time dressed up in morning coat and cravat. And this time Roland heard worry lurking in the old monster’s voice. He wasted no energy on reply.</p>

  <p class="indent">Realizing his coaxing had failed, the Crimson King threw another sneetch. This one flew so high over the pyramid it was only a spark, then dove down upon them with the scream of a falling bomb. Roland took care of it with a single shot and reloaded from a plentitude of shells. He wished, in fact, that the King would send more of the flying grenados against him, because they took his mind temporarily off the dreadful call of the Tower.</p>

  <p class="indentb"><span class="txitc">It’s been waiting for me,</span> he thought with dismay. <span class="txitc">That’s what makes it so hard to resist, I think</span>—<span class="txitc">it’s calling me in particular. Not to Roland, exactly, but to the entire line of Eld . . . and of that line, only I am left.</span></p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2"><a id="page_984"></a>EIGHT</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">At last, as the descending sun began to take on its first hues of orange and Roland felt he could stand it no longer, Patrick put his pencil aside and held the pad out to Roland, frowning. The look made Roland afraid. He had never seen that particular expression in the mute boy’s repertoire. Patrick’s former arrogance was gone.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland took the pad, however, and for a moment was so amazed by what he saw there that he looked away, as if even the eyes in Patrick’s drawing might have the power to fascinate him; might perhaps compel him to put his gun to his temple and blow out his aching brains. It was that good. The greedy and questioning face was long, the cheeks and forehead marked by creases so deep they might have been bottomless. The lips within the foaming beard were full and cruel. It was the mouth of a man who would turn a kiss into a bite if the spirit took him, and the spirit often would.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?”</span> came that screaming, lunatic voice. <span class="txitc">“IT WON’T DO YOU ANY GOOD, WHATEVER IT IS! I HOLD THE TOWER</span>—<span class="txitc">EEEEEEEE!</span>—<span class="txitc">I’M LIKE THE DOG WITH THE GRAPES, ROLAND! IT’S MINE EVEN IF I CAN’T CLIMB IT! AND YOU’LL COME! EEEEE! SAY TRUE! BEFORE THE SHADOW OF THE TOWER REACHES YOUR PALTRY HIDING-PLACE, YOU’LL COME! EEEEEEEE! EEEEEEEE!</span> <span class="txbdco"><span class="txitc">EEEEEEEE!</span>”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick covered his ears, wincing. Now that he had finished drawing, he registered those terrible screams again.</p>

  <p class="indent">That the picture was the greatest work of Patrick’s life Roland had absolutely no doubt. Challenged, <a id="page_985"></a>the boy had done more than rise above himself; he had <span class="txitc">soared</span> above himself and committed genius. The image of the Crimson King was haunting in its clarity. <span class="txitc">The far-seeing instrument can’t explain this, or not all of it,</span> Roland thought. <span class="txitc">It’s as if he has a third eye, one that looks out from his imagination and sees everything. It’s that eye he looks through when he rolls the other two up. To own such an ability as this . . . and to express it with something as humble as a pencil! Ye gods!</span></p>

  <p class="indent">He almost expected to see the pulse begin to beat in the hollows of the old man’s temples, where clocksprings of veins had been delineated with only a few gentle, feathered shadings. At the corner of the full and sensuous lips, the gunslinger could see the wink of a single sharp</p>

  <p class="indent">(<span class="txitc">tusk</span>)</p>

  <p class="indent">tooth, and he thought the lips of the drawing might come to life and part as he looked, revealing a mouthful of fangs: one mere wink of white (which was only a bit of unmarked paper, after all) made the imagination see all the rest, and even to smell the reek of meat that would accompany each outflow of breath. Patrick had perfectly captured a tuft of hair curling from one of the King’s nostrils, and a tiny thread of scar that wove in and out of the King’s right eyebrow like a bit of string. It was a marvelous piece of work, better by far than the portrait the mute boy had done of Susannah. Surely if Patrick had been able to erase the sore from that one, then he could erase the Crimson King from this one, leaving nothing but the balcony railing before him and the closed door to the Tower’s barrel behind. Roland almost expected the Crimson King to breathe and move, and so surely it was done! Surely . . .</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_986"></a>But it was not. It was not, and wanting would not make it so. Not even needing would make it so.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">It’s his eyes,</span> Roland thought. They were wide and terrible, the eyes of a dragon in human form. They were dreadfully good, but they weren’t right. Roland felt a kind of desperate, miserable certainty and shuddered from head to toe, hard enough to make his teeth chatter. <span class="txitc">They’re not quite r</span>—</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick took hold of Roland’s elbow. The gunslinger had been concentrating so fiercely on the drawing that he nearly screamed. He looked up. Patrick nodded at him, then touched his fingers to the corners of his own eyes.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Yes. His eyes. I know that! But what’s wrong with them?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick was still touching the corners of his eyes. Overhead, a flock of rusties flew through a sky that would soon be more purple than blue, squalling the harsh cries that had given them their name. It was toward the Dark Tower that they flew; Roland arose to follow them so they should not have what he could not.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick grabbed him by his hide coat and pulled him back. The boy shook his head violently, and this time pointed toward the road.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“I SAW THAT, ROLAND!</span>” came the cry. <span class="txitc">“YOU THINK THAT WHAT’S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE BIRDS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, DO YOU NOT? EEEEEEEEE! AND IT’S TRUE, SURE! SURE AS SUGAR, SURE AS SALT, SURE AS RUBIES IN KING DANDO’S VAULT</span>—<span class="txitc">EEEEEEEE, HA! I COULD HAVE HAD YOU JUST NOW, BUT WHY BOTHER? I THINK I’D RATHER SEE YOU COME, PISSING AND SHAKING AND UNABLE TO STOP YOURSELF!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_987"></a><span class="txitc">As I will,</span> Roland thought. <span class="txitc">I won’t be able to help myself. I may be able to hold here another ten minutes, perhaps even another twenty, but in the end . . .</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick interrupted his thoughts, once more pointing at the road. Pointing back the way they had come.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland shook his head wearily. “Even if I could fight the pull of the thing—and I couldn’t, it’s all I can do to bide here—retreat would do us no good. Once we’re no longer in cover, he’ll use whatever else he has. He has something, I’m sure of it. And whatever it is, the bullets of my revolver aren’t likely to stop it.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick shook his head hard enough to make his long hair fly from side to side. The grip on Roland’s arm tightened until the boy’s fingernails bit into the gunslinger’s flesh even through three layers of hide clothing. His eyes, always gentle and usually puzzled, now peered at Roland with a look close to fury. He pointed again with his free hand, three quick jabbing gestures with the grimy fore-finger. <span class="txitc">Not</span> at the road, however.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick was pointing at the roses.</p>

  <p class="indent">“What about them?” Roland asked. “Patrick, what about them?”</p>

  <p class="indent">This time Patrick pointed first to the roses, then to the eyes in his picture.</p>

  <p class="indentb">And this time Roland understood.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">NINE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Patrick didn’t want to get them. When Roland gestured to him to go, the boy shook his head at once, whipping his hair once more from side to side, his eyes wide. He made a whistling noise between his <a id="page_988"></a> teeth that was a remarkably good imitation of an oncoming sneetch.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I’ll shoot anything he sends,” Roland said. “You’ve seen me do it. If there was one close enough so that I could pick it myself, I would. But there’s not. So it has to be you who picks the rose and me who gives you cover.”</p>

  <p class="indent">But Patrick only cringed back against the ragged side of the pyramid. Patrick would not. His fear might not have been as great as his talent, but it was surely a close thing. Roland calculated the distance to the nearest rose. It was beyond their scant cover, but perhaps not by too much. He looked at his diminished right hand, which would have to do the plucking, and asked himself how hard it could be. The fact, of course, was that he didn’t know. These were not ordinary roses. For all he knew, the thorns growing up the green stem might have a poison in them that would drop him paralyzed into the tall grass, an easy target.</p>

  <p class="indent">And Patrick would not. Patrick knew that Roland had once had friends, and that now all his friends were dead, and Patrick would not. If Roland had had two hours to work on the boy—possibly even one—he might have broken through his terror. But he didn’t have that time. Sunset had almost come.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Besides, it’s close. I can do it if I have to . . . and I must</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">The weather had warmed enough so there was no need for the clumsy deerskin gloves Susannah had made them, but Roland had been wearing his that morning, and they were still tucked in his belt. He took one of them and cut off the end, so his two remaining fingers would poke through. What remained <a id="page_989"></a>would at least protect his palm from the thorns. He put it on, then rested on one knee with his remaining gun in his other hand, looking at the nearest rose. Would one be enough? It would have to be, he decided. The next was fully six feet further away.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick clutched his shoulder, shaking his head frantically.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I have to,” Roland said, and of course he did. This was his job, not Patrick’s, and he had been wrong to try and make the boy do it in the first place. If he succeeded, fine and well. If he failed and was blown apart here at the edge of Can’-Ka No Rey, at least that dreadful <span class="txitc">pulling</span> would cease.</p>

  <p class="indent">The gunslinger took a deep breath, then leaped from cover and at the rose. At the same moment, Patrick clutched at him again, trying to hold him back. He grabbed a fold of Roland’s coat and twisted him off-true. Roland landed clumsily on his side. The gun flew out of his hand and fell in the tall grass. The Crimson King screamed (the gunslinger heard both triumph and fury in that voice) and then came the approaching whine of another sneetch. Roland closed his mittened right hand around the stem of the rose. The thorns bit through the tough deerskin as if it were no more than a coating of cobwebs. Then into his hand. The pain was enormous, but the song of the rose was sweet. He could see the blaze of yellow deep in its cup, like the blaze of a sun. Or a million of them. He could feel the warmth of blood filling the hollow of his palm and running between the remaining fingers. It soaked the deerskin, blooming another rose on its scuffed brown surface. And here came the <a id="page_990"></a> sneetch that would kill him, blotting out the rose’s song, filling his head and threatening to split his skull.</p>

  <p class="indent">The stem never did break. In the end, the rose tore free of the ground, roots and all. Roland rolled to his left, grabbed his gun, and fired without looking. His heart told him there was no longer time to look. There was a shattering explosion, and the warm air that buffeted his face this time was like a hurricane.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">Close. Very close, that time.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The Crimson King screamed his frustration—<span class="txitc">“EEEEEEEEEEE!”</span>—and the cry was followed by multiple approaching whistles. Patrick pressed himself against the pyramid, face-first. Roland, clutching the rose in his bleeding right hand, rolled onto his back, raised his gun, and waited for the sneetches to make their turn. When they did, he took care of them: one and two and three.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“STILL HERE!”</span> he cried at the old Red King. <span class="txitc">“STILL HERE, YOU OLD COCKSUCKER, MAY IT DO YA FINE!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The Crimson King gave another of his terrible howls, but sent no more sneetches.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“SO NOW YOU HAVE A ROSE!”</span> he screamed. <span class="txitc">“LISTEN TO IT, ROLAND! LISTEN WELL, FOR IT SINGS THE SAME SONG! LISTEN AND COMMALA-COME-COME!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Now that song was all but imperative in Roland’s head. It burned furiously along his nerves. He grasped Patrick and turned him around. “Now,” he said. “For my life, Patrick. For the lives of every man and woman who ever died in my place so I could go on.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">And child,</span> he thought, seeing Jake in the eye of <a id="page_991"></a>his memory. Jake first hanging over darkness, then falling into it.</p>

  <p class="indentb">He stared into the mute boy’s terrified eyes. “Finish it! <span class="txitc">Show me that you can.</span>”</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">TEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Now Roland witnessed an amazing thing: when Patrick took the rose, he wasn’t cut. Not so much as scratched. Roland pulled his own lacerated glove off with his teeth and saw that not only was his palm badly slashed, but one of his remaining fingers now hung by a single bloody tendon. It drooped like something that wants to go to sleep. But Patrick was not cut. The thorns did not pierce him. And the terror had gone out of his eyes. He was looking from the rose to his drawing, back and forth with tender calculation.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“ROLAND! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? COME, GUNSLINGER, FOR SUNSET’S ALMOST NIGH!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">And yes, he would come. One way or the other. Knowing it was so eased him somewhat, enabled him to remain where he was without trembling too badly. His right hand was numb to the wrist, and Roland suspected he would never feel it again. That was all right; it hadn’t been much of a shake since the lobstrosities had gotten at it.</p>

  <p class="indent">And the rose sang <span class="txitc">Yes, Roland, yes</span>—<span class="txitc">you’ll have it again. You’ll be whole again. There will be renewal. Only come.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick plucked a petal from the rose, judged it, then plucked another to go with it. He put them in his mouth. For a moment his face went slack with a peculiar sort of ecstasy, and Roland wondered what the petals might taste like. Overhead the sky was <a id="page_992"></a> growing dark. The shadow of the pyramid that had been hidden by the rocks stretched nearly to the road. When the point of that shadow touched the way that had brought him here, Roland supposed he would go whether the Crimson King still held the Tower approach or not.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“WHAT’S THEE DOING? EEEEEEEEE! WHAT DEVILTRY WORKS IN THY MIND AND THY HEART?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">You’re a great one to speak of deviltry,</span> Roland thought. He took out his watch and snapped back the cover. Beneath the crystal, the hands now sped backward, five o’clock to four, four to three, three to two, two to one, and one to midnight.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Patrick, hurry,” he said. “Quick as you can, I beg, for my time is almost up.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick cupped a hand beneath his mouth and spat out a red paste the color of fresh blood. The color of the Crimson King’s robe. And the exact color of his lunatic’s eyes.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick, on the verge of using color for the first time in his life as an artist, made to dip the tip of his right forefinger into this paste, and then hesitated. An odd certainty came to Roland then: the thorns of these roses only pricked when their roots still tied the plant to Mim, or Mother Earth. Had he gotten his way with Patrick, Mim would have cut those talented hands to ribbons and rendered them useless.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">It’s still ka,</span> the gunslinger thought. <span class="txitc">Even out here in End-W</span>—</p>

  <p class="indent">Before he could finish the thought, Patrick took the gunslinger’s right hand and peered into it with the intensity of a fortune-teller. He scooped up some of the blood that flowed there and mixed it with his rose-paste. Then, carefully, he took a tiny <a id="page_993"></a>bit of this mixture upon the second finger of his right hand. He lowered it to his painting . . . hesitated . . . looked at Roland. Roland nodded to him and Patrick nodded in return, as gravely as a surgeon about to make the first cut in a dangerous operation, then applied his finger to the paper. The tip touched down as delicately as the beak of a hummingbird dipping into a flower. It colored the Crimson King’s left eye and then lifted away. Patrick cocked his head, looking at what he had done with a fascination Roland had never seen on a human face in all his long and wandering time. It was as if the boy were some Manni prophet, finally granted a glimpse of Gan’s face after twenty years of waiting in the desert.</p>

  <p class="indent">Then he broke into an enormous, sunny grin.</p>

  <p class="indent">The response from the Dark Tower was more immediate and—to Roland, at least—immensely gratifying. The old creature pent on the balcony howled in pain.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“WHAT’S THEE DOING? EEEEEEE! EEEEEEEE! STOP! IT BURNS! BURRRRNS!</span> <span class="txbdco"><span class="txitc">EEEEEEEEEEEEE!”</span></span></p>

  <p class="indent">“Now finish the other,” Roland said. “Quickly! For your life and mine!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick colored the other eye with the same delicate dip of the finger. Now two brilliant crimson eyes looked out of Patrick’s black-and-white drawing, eyes that had been colored with attar of rose and the blood of Eld; eyes that burned with Hell’s own fire.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was done.</p>

  <p class="indentb">Roland produced the eraser at last, and held it out to Patrick. “Make him gone,” he said. “Make yonder foul hob gone from this world and every world. Make him gone at last.”</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2"><a id="page_994"></a>ELEVEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">There was no question it would work. From the moment Patrick first touched the eraser to his drawing—to that curl of nostril-hair, as it happened—the Crimson King began to scream in fresh pain and horror from his balcony redoubt. And in <span class="txitc">understanding</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick hesitated, looking at Roland for confirmation, and Roland nodded. “Aye, Patrick. His time has come and you’re to be his executioner. Go on with it.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The Old King threw four more sneetches, and Roland took care of them all with calm ease. After that he threw no more, for he had no hands with which to throw. His shrieks rose to gibbering whines that Roland thought would surely never leave his ears.</p>

  <p class="indent">The mute boy erased the full, sensuous mouth from within its foam of beard, and as he did it, the screams first grew muffled and then ceased. In the end Patrick erased everything but the eyes, and these the remaining bit of rubber would not even blur. They remained until the piece of pink gum (originally part of a Pencil-Pak bought in a Norwich, Connecticut, Woolworth’s during a back-to-school sale in August of 1958) had been reduced to a shred the boy could not even hold between his long, dirty nails. And so he cast it away and showed the gunslinger what remained: two malevolent blood-red orbs floating three-quarters of the way up the page.</p>

  <p class="indentb">All the rest of him was gone.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2"><a id="page_995"></a>TWELVE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">The shadow of the pyramid’s tip had come to touch the road; now the sky in the west changed from the orange of a reaptide bonfire to that cauldron of blood Roland had seen in his dreams ever since childhood. When it did, the call of the Tower doubled, then trebled. Roland felt it reach out and grasp him with invisible hands. The time of his destiny was come.</p>

  <p class="indent">Yet there was this boy. This friendless boy. Roland would not leave him to die here at the end of End-World if he could help it. He had no interest in atonement, and yet Patrick had come to stand for all the murders and betrayals that had finally brought him to the Dark Tower. Roland’s family was dead; his misbegotten son had been the last. Now would Eld and Tower be joined.</p>

  <p class="indent">First, though—or last—this.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Patrick, listen to me,” he said, taking the boy’s shoulder with his whole left hand and his mutilated right. “If you’d live to make all the pictures ka has stored away in your future, ask me not a single question nor ask me to repeat a single thing.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The boy looked at him, large-eyed and silent in the red and dying light. And the Song of the Tower rose around them to a mighty shout that was nothing but <span class="txitc">commala</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Go back to the road. Pick up all the cans that are whole. That should be enough to feed you. Go back the way we came. Never leave the road. You’ll do fine.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick nodded with perfect understanding. Roland saw he believed, and that was good. Belief <a id="page_996"></a> would protect him even more surely than a revolver, even one with the sandalwood grips.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Go back to the Federal. Go back to the robot, Stuttering Bill that was. Tell him to take you to a door that swings open on America-side. If it won’t open to your hand, <span class="txitc">draw</span> it open with thy pencil. Do’ee understand?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick nodded again. Of course he understood.</p>

  <p class="indent">“If ka should eventually lead you to Susannah in any where or when, tell her Roland loves her still, and with all his heart.” He drew Patrick to him and kissed the boy’s mouth. “Give her that. Do’ee understand?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick nodded.</p>

  <p class="indent">“All right. I go. Long days and pleasant nights. May we meet in the clearing at the end of the path when all worlds end.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Yet even then he knew this would not happen, for the worlds would never end, not now, and for him there would be no clearing. For Roland Deschain of Gilead, last of Eld’s line, the path ended at the Dark Tower. And that did him fine.</p>

  <p class="indent">He rose to his feet. The boy looked up at him with wide, wondering eyes, clutching his pad. Roland turned. He drew in breath to the bottom of his lungs and let it out in a great cry.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txitc">“NOW COMES ROLAND TO THE DARK TOWER! I HAVE BEEN TRUE AND I STILL CARRY THE GUN OF MY FATHER AND YOU WILL OPEN TO MY HAND!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Patrick watched him stride to where the road ended, a black silhouette against that bloody burning sky. He watched as Roland walked among the roses, and sat shivering in the shadows as Roland began to cry the names of his friends and loved <a id="page_997"></a>ones and ka-mates; those names carried clear in that strange air, as if they would echo forever.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Steven Deschain, he of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Gabrielle Deschain, she of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Cortland Andrus, he of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Cuthbert Allgood, he of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Alain Johns, he of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Jamie DeCurry, he of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Vannay the Wise, he of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of Hax the Cook, he of Gilead!</p>

  <p class="indent">“I come in the name of David the hawk, he of Gilead and the sky!</p>

  <p class="indent">After that came the sound of a horn. It simultaneously chilled Patrick’s blood and exalted him. The echoes faded into silence. Then, perhaps a minute later, came a great, echoing boom: the sound of a door swinging shut forever.</p>

  <p class="indentb">And after that came silence.</p>

  <h3 class="h3a"><span class="smallcaps2">THIRTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Patrick sat where he was at the base of the pyramid, shivering, until Old Star and Old Mother rose in the sky. The song of the roses and the Tower hadn’t ceased, but it had grown low and sleepy, little more than a murmur.</p>

  <p class="indent">At last he went back to the road, gathered as many whole cans as he could (there was a surprising number of them, considering the force of the explosion that had demolished the cart), and found a deerskin sack that would hold them. He realized he had forgotten his pencil and went back to get it.</p>

  <p class="indent">Beside the pencil, gleaming in the starlight, was Roland’s watch.</p>

  <p class="indent">The boy took it with a small (and nervous) hoot of glee. He put it in his pocket. Then he went back <a id="page_999"></a>to the road and slung his little sack of gunna over his shoulder.</p>

  <p class="indentb">I can tell you that he walked until nearly midnight, and that he looked at the watch before taking his rest. I can tell you that the watch had stopped completely. I can tell you that, come noon of the following day, he looked at it again and saw that it had begun to run in the correct direction once more, albeit very slowly. But of Patrick I can tell you no more, not whether he made it back to the Federal, not whether he found Stuttering Bill that was, not whether he eventually came once more to America-side. I can tell you none of these things, say sorry. Here the darkness hides him from my storyteller’s eye and he must go on alone.</p>
