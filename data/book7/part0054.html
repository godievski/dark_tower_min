  TO THE DARK TOWER CAME”</span></a></h3>

  <p class="imaget">I</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">My first thought was, he lied in every word,<br class="calibre1" />
  That hoary cripple, with malicious eye<br class="calibre1" />
  Askance to watch the workings of his lie<br class="calibre1" />
  On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford<br class="calibre1" />
  Suppression of the glee, that pursed and scored<br class="calibre1" />
  Its edge, at one more victim gained thereby.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">II</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">What else should he be set for, with his staff?<br class="calibre1" />
  What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare<br class="calibre1" />
  All travellers who might find him posted there,<br class="calibre1" />
  And ask the road? I guessed what skull-like laugh<br class="calibre1" />
  Would break, what crutch ’gin write my epitaph<br class="calibre1" />
  For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget"><a id="page_1036"></a>III</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">If at his counsel I should turn aside<br class="calibre1" />
  Into that ominous tract which, all agree,<br class="calibre1" />
  Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly<br class="calibre1" />
  I did turn as he pointed, neither pride<br class="calibre1" />
  Nor hope rekindling at the end descried,<br class="calibre1" />
  So much as gladness that some end might be.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">IV</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,<br class="calibre1" />
  What with my search drawn out through years,<br class="calibre1" />
  my hope<br class="calibre1" />
  Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope<br class="calibre1" />
  With that obstreperous joy success would bring,<br class="calibre1" />
  I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring<br class="calibre1" />
  My heart made, finding failure in its scope.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">V</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">As when a sick man very near to death<br class="calibre1" />
  Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end<br class="calibre1" />
  The tears and takes the farewell of each friend,<br class="calibre1" />
  And hears one bid the other go, draw breath<br class="calibre1" />
  Freelier outside, (‘since all is o’er,’ he saith<br class="calibre1" />
  ‘And the blow fallen no grieving can amend;’)</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">VI</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">When some discuss if near the other graves<br class="calibre1" />
  Be room enough for this, and when a day</span> <a id="page_1037"></a><br class="calibre1" />
  <span class="txitc">Suits best for carrying the corpse away,<br class="calibre1" />
  With care about the banners, scarves and staves<br class="calibre1" />
  And still the man hears all, and only craves<br class="calibre1" />
  He may not shame such tender love and stay.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">VII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,<br class="calibre1" />
  Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ<br class="calibre1" />
  So many times among ‘The Band’ to wit,<br class="calibre1" />
  The knights who to the Dark Tower’s<br class="calibre1" />
  search addressed<br class="calibre1" />
  Their steps—that just to fail as they, seemed best,<br class="calibre1" />
  And all the doubt was now—should I be fit?</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">VIII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">So, quiet as despair I turned from him,<br class="calibre1" />
  That hateful cripple, out of his highway<br class="calibre1" />
  Into the path he pointed. All the day<br class="calibre1" />
  Had been a dreary one at best, and dim<br class="calibre1" />
  Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim<br class="calibre1" />
  Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">IX</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">For mark! No sooner was I fairly found<br class="calibre1" />
  Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,<br class="calibre1" />
  Than, pausing to throw backwards a last view<br class="calibre1" />
  O’er the safe road, ’twas gone; grey plain all round:<br class="calibre1" />
  Nothing but plain to the horizon’s bound.<br class="calibre1" />
  I might go on, naught else remained to do.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget"><a id="page_1038"></a>X</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">So on I went. I think I never saw<br class="calibre1" />
  Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve:<br class="calibre1" />
  For flowers—as well expect a cedar grove!<br class="calibre1" />
  But cockle, spurge, according to their law<br class="calibre1" />
  Might propagate their kind with none to awe,<br class="calibre1" />
  You’d think; a burr had been a treasure trove.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XI</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">No! penury, inertness and grimace,<br class="calibre1" />
  In some strange sort, were the land’s portion. ‘See<br class="calibre1" />
  Or shut your eyes,’ said Nature peevishly,<br class="calibre1" />
  ‘It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:<br class="calibre1" />
  ’Tis the Last Judgement’s fire must cure this place<br class="calibre1" />
  Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.’</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk<br class="calibre1" />
  Above its mates, the head was chopped, the bents<br class="calibre1" />
  Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents<br class="calibre1" />
  In the dock’s harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to baulk<br class="calibre1" />
  All hope of greenness? ’tis a brute must walk<br class="calibre1" />
  Pashing their life out, with a brute’s intents.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XIII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair<br class="calibre1" />
  In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud</span><br class="calibre1" />
  <a id="page_1039"></a><span class="txitc">Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.<br class="calibre1" />
  One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,<br class="calibre1" />
  Stood stupefied, however he came there:<br class="calibre1" />
  Thrust out past service from the devil’s stud!</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XIV</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,<br class="calibre1" />
  With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain.<br class="calibre1" />
  And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;<br class="calibre1" />
  Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;<br class="calibre1" />
  I never saw a brute I hated so;<br class="calibre1" />
  He must be wicked to deserve such pain.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XV</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart,<br class="calibre1" />
  As a man calls for wine before he fights,<br class="calibre1" />
  I asked one draught of earlier, happier sights,<br class="calibre1" />
  Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.<br class="calibre1" />
  Think first, fight afterwards, the soldier’s art:<br class="calibre1" />
  One taste of the old time sets all to rights.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XVI</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Not it! I fancied Cuthbert’s reddening face<br class="calibre1" />
  Beneath its garniture of curly gold,<br class="calibre1" />
  Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold<br class="calibre1" />
  An arm to mine to fix me to the place,<br class="calibre1" />
  The way he used. Alas, one night’s disgrace!<br class="calibre1" />
  Out went my heart’s new fire and left it cold.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget"><a id="page_1040"></a>XVII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Giles then, the soul of honour—there he stands<br class="calibre1" />
  Frank as ten years ago when knighted first,<br class="calibre1" />
  What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.<br class="calibre1" />
  Good—but the scene shifts—faugh!<br class="calibre1" />
  what hangman hands<br class="calibre1" />
  Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands<br class="calibre1" />
  Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XVIII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Better this present than a past like that:<br class="calibre1" />
  Back therefore to my darkening path again!<br class="calibre1" />
  No sound, no sight as far as eye could strain.<br class="calibre1" />
  Will the night send a howlet or a bat?<br class="calibre1" />
  I asked: when something on the dismal flat<br class="calibre1" />
  Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XIX</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">A sudden little river crossed my path<br class="calibre1" />
  As unexpected as a serpent comes.<br class="calibre1" />
  No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;<br class="calibre1" />
  This, as it frothed by, might have been a bath<br class="calibre1" />
  For the fiend’s glowing hoof—to see the wrath<br class="calibre1" />
  Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XX</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">So petty yet so spiteful! All along,<br class="calibre1" />
  Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it;</span><br class="calibre1" />
  <a id="page_1041"></a><span class="txitc">Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit<br class="calibre1" />
  Of mute despair, a suicidal throng:<br class="calibre1" />
  The river which had done them all the wrong,<br class="calibre1" />
  Whate’er that was, rolled by, deterred no whit.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXI</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Which, while I forded—good saints,<br class="calibre1" />
  how I feared<br class="calibre1" />
  To set my foot upon a dead man’s cheek,<br class="calibre1" />
  Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek<br class="calibre1" />
  For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!<br class="calibre1" />
  —It may have been a water-rat I speared,<br class="calibre1" />
  But, ugh! it sounded like a baby’s shriek.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Glad was I when I reached the other bank.<br class="calibre1" />
  Now for a better country. Vain presage!<br class="calibre1" />
  Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage,<br class="calibre1" />
  Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank<br class="calibre1" />
  Soil to a plash? Toads in a poisoned tank<br class="calibre1" />
  Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage—</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXIII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque,<br class="calibre1" />
  What penned them there, with all the plain to choose?<br class="calibre1" />
  No footprint leading to that horrid mews,<br class="calibre1" />
  None out of it. Mad brewage set to work<br class="calibre1" />
  Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk<br class="calibre1" />
  Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget"><a id="page_1042"></a>XXIV</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">And more than that—a furlong on—why, there!<br class="calibre1" />
  What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,<br class="calibre1" />
  Or brake, not wheel—that harrow fit to reel<br class="calibre1" />
  Men’s bodies out like silk? With all the air<br class="calibre1" />
  Of Tophet’s tool, on earth left unaware<br class="calibre1" />
  Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXV</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Then came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,<br class="calibre1" />
  Next a marsh it would seem, and now mere earth<br class="calibre1" />
  Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,<br class="calibre1" />
  Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood<br class="calibre1" />
  Changes and off he goes!) within a rood—<br class="calibre1" />
  Bog, clay and rubble, sand, and stark black dearth.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXVI</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Now blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,<br class="calibre1" />
  Now patches where some leanness of the soil’s<br class="calibre1" />
  Broke into moss, or substances like boils;<br class="calibre1" />
  Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him<br class="calibre1" />
  Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim<br class="calibre1" />
  Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXVII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">And just as far as ever from the end!<br class="calibre1" />
  Naught in the distance but the evening, naught</span><br class="calibre1" />
  <a id="page_1043"></a><span class="txitc">To point my footstep further! At the thought,<br class="calibre1" />
  A great black bird, Apollyon’s bosom friend,<br class="calibre1" />
  Sailed past, not best his wide wing dragon-penned<br class="calibre1" />
  That brushed my cap—perchance the guide I sought.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXVIII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,<br class="calibre1" />
  ’Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place<br class="calibre1" />
  All round to mountains—with such name to grace<br class="calibre1" />
  Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.<br class="calibre1" />
  How thus they had surprised me—solve it, you!<br class="calibre1" />
  How to get from them was no clearer case.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXIX</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Yet half I seemed to recognise some trick<br class="calibre1" />
  Of mischief happened to me, God knows when—<br class="calibre1" />
  In a bad dream perhaps. Here ended, then<br class="calibre1" />
  Progress this way. When, in the very nick<br class="calibre1" />
  Of giving up, one time more, came a click<br class="calibre1" />
  As when a trap shuts—you’re inside the den.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXX</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Burningly it came on me all at once,<br class="calibre1" />
  This was the place! those two hills on the right,<br class="calibre1" />
  Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight;<br class="calibre1" />
  While to the left a tall scalped mountain . . . Dunce,<br class="calibre1" />
  Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,<br class="calibre1" />
  After a life spent training for the sight!</span></p>

  <p class="imaget"><a id="page_1044"></a>XXXI</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?<br class="calibre1" />
  The round squat turret, blind as the fool’s heart,<br class="calibre1" />
  Built of brown stone, without a counterpart<br class="calibre1" />
  In the whole world. The tempest’s mocking elf<br class="calibre1" />
  Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf<br class="calibre1" />
  He strikes on, only when the timbers start.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXXII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Not see? because of night perhaps?—why day<br class="calibre1" />
  Came back again for that! before it left<br class="calibre1" />
  The dying sunset kindled through a cleft:<br class="calibre1" />
  The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,<br class="calibre1" />
  Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,—<br class="calibre1" />
  ‘Now stab and end the creature—to the heft!’</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXXIII</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">Not hear? When noise was everywhere! it tolled<br class="calibre1" />
  Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears<br class="calibre1" />
  Of all the lost adventurers, my peers—<br class="calibre1" />
  How such a one was strong, and such was bold,<br class="calibre1" />
  And such was fortunate, yet each of old<br class="calibre1" />
  Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.</span></p>

  <p class="imaget">XXXIV</p>

  <p class="imaget"><span class="txitc">There they stood, ranged along the hillsides, met<br class="calibre1" />
  To view the last of me, a living frame</span><br class="calibre1" />
  <a id="page_1045"></a><span class="txitc">For one more picture! In a sheet of flame<br class="calibre1" />
  I saw them and I knew them all. And yet<br class="calibre1" />
  Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,<br class="calibre1" />
  And blew. ‘Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.’</span><a id="page_1046"></a></p>
