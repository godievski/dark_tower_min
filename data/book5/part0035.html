  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">ONE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">See this now, see it very well:</p>

  <p class="indent">Here is a road as wide and as well-maintained as any secondary road in America, but of the smooth packed dirt the Calla-folk call oggan. Ditches for runoff border both sides; here and there neat and well-maintained wooden culverts run beneath the oggan. In the faint, unearthly light that comes before dawn, a dozen bucka waggons—they are the kind driven by the Manni, with rounded canvas tops—roll along the road. The canvas is bright clean white, to reflect the sun and keep the interiors cool on hot summer days, and they look like strange, low-floating clouds. The cumulus kind, may it do ya. Each waggon is drawn by a team of six mules or four horses. On the seat of each, driving, are either a pair of fighters or of designated child-minders. Overholser is driving the lead waggon, with Margaret Eisenhart beside him. Next in line comes Roland of Gilead, mated with Ben Slightman. Fifth is Tian and Zalia Jaffords. Seventh is Eddie and Susannah Dean. Susannah’s wheelchair is folded up in the waggon behind her. Bucky and Annabelle Javier are in charge of the tenth. On the peak-seat of the last waggon are Father Donald Callahan and Rosalita Munoz.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_853"></a>Inside the buckas are ninety-nine children. The left-over twin—the one that makes for an odd number—is Benny Slightman, of course. He is riding in the last waggon. (He felt uncomfortable about going with his father.) The children don’t speak. Some of the younger ones have gone back to sleep; they will have to be awakened shortly, when the waggons reach their destination. Ahead, now less than a mile, is the place where the path into the arroyo country splits off to the left. On the right, the land runs down a mild slope to the river. All the drivers keep looking to the east, toward the constant darkness that is Thunderclap. They are watching for an approaching dust-cloud. There is none. Not yet. Even the seminon winds have fallen still. Callahan’s prayers seem to have been answered, at least in that regard.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TWO</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Ben Slightman, sitting next to Roland on the bucka’s peak-seat, spoke in a voice so low the gunslinger could barely hear him. “What will’ee do to me, then?”</p>

  <p class="indent">If asked, when the waggons set out from Calla Bryn Sturgis, to give odds on Slightman’s surviving this day, Roland might have put them at five in a hundred. Surely no better. There were two crucial questions that needed to be asked and then answered correctly. The first had to come from Slightman himself. Roland hadn’t really expected the man to ask it, but here it was, out of his mouth. Roland turned his head and looked at him.</p>

  <p class="indent">Vaughn Eisenhart’s foreman was very pale, but <a id="page_854"></a>he took off his spectacles and met Roland’s gaze. The gunslinger ascribed no special courage to this. Surely Slightman the Elder had had time to take Roland’s measure and knew that he <span class="txit">must</span> look the gunslinger in the eye if he was to have any hope at all, little as he might like to do it.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yar, I know,” Slightman said. His voice was steady, at least so far. “Know what? That <span class="txit">you</span> know.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Have since we took your pard, I suppose,” Roland said. The word was deliberately sarcastic (sarcasm was the only form of humor Roland truly understood), and Slightman winced at it: pard. Your pard. But he nodded, eyes still steady on Roland’s.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I had to figure that if you knew about Andy, you knew about me. Although he’d never have peached on me. Such wasn’t in his programming.” At last it was too much and he could bear the eye-contact no longer. He looked down, biting his lip. “Mostly I knew because of Jake.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland wasn’t able to keep the surprise out of his face.</p>

  <p class="indent">“He changed. He didn’t mean to, not as trig as he is—and as brave—but he did. Not toward me, toward my boy. Over the last week, week and a half. Benny was only . . . well, puzzled, I guess you’d say. He felt something but didn’t know what it was. I did. It was like your boy didn’t want to be around him anymore. I asked myself what could do that. The answer seemed pretty clear. Clear as short beer, do ya.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland was falling behind Overholser’s waggon. He flicked the reins over the backs of his own team. They moved a little faster. From behind <a id="page_855"></a>them came the quiet sound of the children, some talking now but most snoring, and the muted jingle of trace. He’d asked Jake to collect up a small box of children’s possessions, and had seen the boy doing it. He was a good boy who never put off a chore. This morning he wore a dayrider hat to keep the sun out of his eyes, and his father’s gun. He rode on the seat of the eleventh waggon, with one of the Estrada men. He guessed that Slightman had a good boy, too, which had gone far toward making this the mess that it was.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Jake was at the Dogan one night when you and Andy were there, passing on news of your neighbors,” Roland said. On the seat beside him, Slightman winced like a man who has just been punched in the belly.</p>

  <p class="indent">“There,” he said. “Yes, I could almost sense . . . or thought I could . . . ” A longer pause, and then: <span class="txit">“Fuck.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Roland looked east. A little brighter over there now, but still no dust. Which was good. Once the dust appeared, the Wolves would come in a rush. Their gray horses would be fast. Continuing on, speaking almost idly, Roland asked the other question. If Slightman answered in the negative, he wouldn’t live to see the coming of the Wolves no matter how fast their gray horses rode.</p>

  <p class="indent">“If you’d found him, Slightman—if you’d found <span class="txit">my</span> boy—would you have killed him?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman put his spectacles back on as he struggled with it. Roland couldn’t tell if he understood the importance of the question or not. He waited to see if the father of Jake’s friend would live or die. He’d have to decide quickly; they were approaching <a id="page_856"></a>the place where the waggons would stop and the children would get down.</p>

  <p class="indent">The man at last raised his head and met Roland’s eyes again. He opened his mouth to speak and couldn’t. The fact of the matter was clear enough: he could answer the gunslinger’s question, or he could look into the gunslinger’s face, but he could not do both at the same time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Dropping his gaze back to the splintery wood between his feet, Slightman said: “Yes, I reckon we would have killed him.” A pause. A nod. When he moved his head a tear fell from one eye and splashed on the wood of the peak-seat’s floor. “Yar, what else?” Now he looked up; now he could meet Roland’s eyes again, and when he did he saw his fate had been decided. “Make it quick,” said he, “and don’t let me boy see it happen. Beg ya please.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland flapped the reins over the mules’ backs again. Then he said: “I won’t be the one to stop your miserable breath.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman’s breath <span class="txit">did</span> stop. Telling the gunslinger that yes, he would have killed a twelve-year-old boy to protect his secret, his face had had a kind of strained nobility. Now it wore hope instead, and hope made it ugly. Nearly grotesque. Then he let his breath out in a ragged sigh and said, “You’re fooling with me. A-teasing me. You’re going to kill me, all right. Why would you not?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“A coward judges all he sees by what he is,” Roland remarked. “I’d not kill you unless I had to, Slightman, because I love my own boy. You must understand that much, don’t you? To love a boy?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yar.” Slightman lowered his head again and began to rub the back of his sunburned neck. The <a id="page_857"></a>neck he must have thought would end this day packed in dirt.</p>

  <p class="indent">“But you have to understand something. For your own good and Benny’s as much as ours. If the Wolves win, you <span class="txit">will</span> die. That much you can be sure of. ‘Take it to the bank,’ Eddie and Susannah say.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman was looking at him again, eyes narrowed behind his specs.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Hear me well, Slightman, and take understanding from what I say. We’re not going to be where the Wolves think we’re going to be, and neither are the kiddies. Win or lose, this time they’re going to leave some bodies behind. And win or lose, they’ll know they were misled. Who was there in Calla Bryn Sturgis to mislead them? Only two. Andy and Ben Slightman. Andy’s shut down, gone beyond the reach of their vengeance.” He gave Slightman a smile that was as cold as the earth’s north end. “But you’re not. Nor the only one you care for in your poor excuse for a heart.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman sat considering this. It was clearly a new idea to him, but once he saw the logic of it, it was undeniable.</p>

  <p class="indent">“They’ll likely think you switched sides a-purpose,” Roland said, “but even if you could convince them it was an accident, they’d kill you just the same. And your son, as well. For vengeance.”</p>

  <p class="indent">A red stain had seeped into the man’s cheeks as the gunslinger spoke—roses of shame, Roland supposed—but as he considered the probability of his son’s murder at the hands of the Wolves, he grew white once more. Or perhaps it was the thought of Benny being taken east that did it—being taken <a id="page_858"></a>east and roont. “I’m sorry,” he said. “Sorry for what I’ve done.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Balls to your sorry,” Roland said. “Ka works and the world moves on.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman made no reply.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I’m disposed to send you with the kids, just as I said I would,” Roland told him. “If things go as I hope, you won’t see a single moment’s action. If things don’t go as I hope, you want to remember Sarey Adams is boss of that shooting match, and if I talk to her after, you want to hope that she says you did everything you were told to do.” When this met with only more silence from Slightman, the gunslinger spoke sharply. “Tell me you understand, gods damn you. I want to hear ‘Yes, Roland, I ken.’ ”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes, Roland, I ken very well.” There was a pause. “If we <span class="txit">do</span> win, will the <span class="txit">folken</span> find out, do’ee reckon? Find out about . . . me?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Not from Andy, they won’t,” Roland said. “His blabber’s done. And not from me, if you do as you now promise. Not from my ka-tet, either. Not out of respect for you, but out of respect for Jake Chambers. And if the Wolves fall into the trap I’ve laid them, why would the <span class="txit">folken</span> ever suspect another traitor?” He measured Slightman with his cool eyes. “They’re innocent folk. Trusting. As ye know. Certainly ye used it.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The flush came back. Slightman looked down at the floor of the peak-seat again. Roland looked up and saw the place he was looking for now less than a quarter of a mile ahead. Good. There was still no dust-cloud on the eastern horizon, but he could feel it gathering in his mind. The Wolves were coming, <a id="page_859"></a>oh yes. Somewhere across the river they had dismounted their train and mounted their horses and were riding like hell. And from it, he had no doubt.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I did it for my son,” Slightman said. “Andy came to me and said they would surely take him. Somewhere over there, Roland—” He pointed east, toward Thunderclap. “Somewhere over there are poor creatures called Breakers. Prisoners. Andy says they’re telepaths and psychokinetics, and although I ken neither word, I know they’re to do with the mind. The Breakers are human, and they eat what we eat to nourish their bodies, but they need other food, <span class="txit">special</span> food, to nourish whatever it is that makes <span class="txit">them</span> special.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Brain-food,” Roland said. He remembered that his mother had called fish brain-food. And then, for no reason he could tell, he found himself thinking of Susannah’s nocturnal prowls. Only it wasn’t Susannah who visited that midnight banquet hall; it was Mia. Daughter of none.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yar, I reckon,” Slightman agreed. “Anyway, it’s something only twins have, something that links them mind-to-mind. And these fellows—not the Wolves, but they who send the Wolves—take it out. When it’s gone, the kids’re idiots. Roont. It’s <span class="txit">food,</span> Roland, do ya kennit? <span class="txit">That’s</span> why they take em! To feed their goddamned <span class="txit">Breakers</span>! Not their bellies or their bodies, but their minds! And I don’t even know what it is they’ve been set to break!”</p>

  <p class="indent">“The two Beams that still hold the Tower,” Roland said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman was thunderstruck. And fearful. “The <a id="page_860"></a>Dark Tower?” He whispered the words. “Do ya say so?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I do,” Roland said. “Who’s Finli? Finli o’ Tego.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I don’t know. A voice that takes my reports, is all. A taheen, I think—do you know what that is?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Do you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman shook his head.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Then we’ll leave it. Mayhap I’ll meet him in time and he’ll answer to hand for this business.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman did not reply, but Roland sensed his doubt. That was all right. They’d almost made it now, and the gunslinger felt an invisible band which had been cinched about his middle begin to loosen. He turned fully to the foreman for the first time. “There’s always been someone like you for Andy to cozen, Slightman; I have no doubt it’s mostly what he was left here for, just as I have no doubt that your daughter, Benny’s sister, didn’t die an accidental death. They always need one left-over twin, and one weak parent.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You can’t—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Shut up. You’ve said all that’s good for you.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman sat silent beside Roland on the seat.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I understand betrayal. I’ve done my share of it, once to Jake himself. But that doesn’t change what you are; let’s have that straight. You’re a carrion-bird. A rustie turned vulture.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The color was back in Slightman’s cheeks, turning them the shade of claret. “I did what I did for my boy,” he said stubbornly.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland spat into his cupped hand, then raised the hand and caressed Slightman’s cheek with it. The cheek was currently full of blood, and hot to the touch. Then the gunslinger took hold of the <a id="page_861"></a>spectacles Slightman wore and jiggled them slightly on the man’s nose. “Won’t wash,” he said, very quietly. “Because of these. This is how they mark you, Slightman. This is your brand. You tell yourself you did it for your boy because it gets you to sleep at night. <span class="txit">I</span> tell <span class="txit">myself</span> that what I did to Jake I did so as not to lose my chance at the Tower . . . and that gets <span class="txit">me</span> to sleep at night. The difference between us, the <span class="txit">only</span> difference, is that I never took a pair of spectacles.” He wiped his hand on his pants. “You sold out, Slightman. And you have forgotten the face of your father.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Let me be,” Slightman whispered. He wiped the slick of the gunslinger’s spittle from his cheek. It was replaced by his own tears. “For my boy’s sake.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland nodded. “That’s all this is, for your boy’s sake. You drag him behind you like a dead chicken. Well, never mind. If all goes as I hope, you may live your life with him in the Calla, and grow old in the regard of your neighbors. You’ll be one of those who stood up to the Wolves when the gunslingers came to town along the Path of the Beam. When you can’t walk, he’ll walk with you and hold you up. I see this, but I don’t like what I see. Because a man who’ll sell his soul for a pair of spectacles will resell it for some other prink-a-dee—even cheaper—and sooner or later your boy will find out what you are, anyway. The best thing that could happen to your son today is for you to die a hero.” And then, before Slightman could reply, Roland raised his voice and shouted. “Hey, Overholser! Ho, the waggon! <span class="txit">Overholser!</span> Pull on over! We’re here! Say thankya!”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_862"></a>“Roland—” Slightman began.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No,” Roland said, tying off the reins. “Palaver’s done. Just remember what I said, sai: if you get a chance to die a hero today, do your son a favor and take it.”</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">THREE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">At first everything went according to plan and they called it ka. When things began going wrong and the dying started, they called that ka, too. Ka, the gunslinger could have told them, was often the last thing you had to rise above.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">FOUR</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Roland had explained to the children what he wanted of them while still on the common, under the flaring torches. Now, with daylight brightening (but the sun still waiting in the wings), they took their places perfectly, lining up in the road from oldest to youngest, each pair of twins holding hands. The buckas were parked on the left side of the road, their offside wheels just above the ditch. The only gap was where the track into the arroyo country split off from East Road. Standing beside the children in a stretched line were the minders, their number now swelled to well over a dozen with the addition of Tian, Pere Callahan, Slightman, and Wayne Overholser. Across from them, positioned in a line above the righthand ditch, were Eddie, Susannah, Rosa, Margaret Eisenhart, and Tian’s wife, Zalia. Each of the women wore a silk-lined reed sack filled with plates. Stacked in the ditch below and behind them <a id="page_863"></a>were boxes containing more Orizas. There were two hundred plates in all.</p>

  <p class="indent">Eddie glanced across the river. Still no dust. Susannah gave him a nervous smile, which he returned in kind. This was the hard part—the scary part. Later, he knew, the red fog would wrap him up and carry him away. Now he was too aware. What he was aware of most was that right now they were as helpless and vulnerable as a turtle without its shell.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake came hustling up the line of children, carrying the box of collected odds and ends: hair ribbons, a teething infant’s comfort-chewy, a whistle whittled from a yew-stick, an old shoe with most of the sole gone, a mateless sock. There were perhaps two dozen similar items.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Benny Slightman!” Roland barked. “Frank Tavery! Francine Tavery! To me!”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Here, now!” Benny Slightman’s father said, immediately alarmed. “What’re you calling my son out of line f—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“To do his duty, just as you’ll do yours,” Roland said. “Not another word.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The four children he had called appeared before him. The Taverys were flushed and out of breath, eyes shining, still holding hands.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Listen, now, and make me repeat not a single word,” Roland said. Benny and the Taverys leaned forward anxiously. Although clearly impatient to be off, Jake was less anxious; he knew this part, and most of what would follow. What Roland <span class="txit">hoped</span> would follow.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland spoke to the children, but loud enough for the strung-out line of child-minders to hear, too. “You’re to go up the path,” he said, “and every few <a id="page_864"></a>feet you leave something, as if ’twere dropped on a hard, fast march. And I expect <span class="txit">you</span> four to make a hard, fast march. Don’t run, but just below it. Mind your footing. Go to where the path branches—that’s half a mile—and no farther. D’you ken? <span class="txit">Not one step farther.</span>”</p>

  <p class="indent">They nodded eagerly. Roland switched his gaze to the adults standing tensely behind them.</p>

  <p class="indent">“These four get a two-minute start. Then the rest of the twins go, oldest first, youngest last. They won’t be going far; the last pairs will hardly get off the road.” Roland raised his voice to a commanding shout. <span class="txit">“Children! When you hear this, come back! Come to me a-hurry!”</span> Roland put the first two fingers of his left hand into the corners of his mouth and blew a whistle so piercing that several children put their hands to their ears.</p>

  <p class="indent">Annabelle Javier said, “Sai, if you mean for the children to hide in one of the caves, why would you call them back?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Because they’re not going into the caves,” Roland said. “They’re going down there.” He pointed east. “Lady Oriza is going to take care of the children. They’re going to hide in the rice, just this side of the river.” They all looked where he pointed, and so it was they all saw the dust at the same time.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Wolves were coming.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">FIVE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">“Our company’s on the way, sugarpie,” Susannah said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland nodded, then turned to Jake. “Go on, Jake. Just as I say.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_865"></a>Jake pulled a double handful of stuff from the box and handed it to the Tavery twins. Then he jumped the lefthand ditch, graceful as a deer, and started up the arroyo track with Benny beside him. Frank and Francine were right behind; as Roland watched, Francine let a little hat fall from her hand.</p>

  <p class="indent">“All right,” Overholser said. “I ken some of it, do ya. The Wolves’ll see the cast-offs and be even surer the kids are up there. But why send the rest of em north at all, gunslinger? Why not just march em down to the rice right now?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Because we have to assume the Wolves can smell the track of prey as well as real Wolves,” Roland said. He raised his voice again. <span class="txit">“Children, up the path! Oldest first! Hold the hand of your partner and don’t let go! Come back at my whistle!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The children started off, helped into the ditch by Callahan, Sarey Adams, the Javiers, and Ben Slightman. All the adults looked anxious; only Benny’s Da’ looked mistrustful, as well.</p>

  <p class="indent">“The Wolves will start in because they’ve reason to believe the children are up there,” Roland said, “but they’re not fools, Wayne. They’ll look for sign and we’ll give it to em. If they smell—and I’d bet this town’s last rice crop that they do—they’ll have scent as well as dropped shoes and ribbons to look at. After the smell of the main group stops, that of the four I sent first will carry on yet awhile farther. It may suck em in deeper, or it may not. By then it shouldn’t matter.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“But—”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland ignored him. He turned toward his little band of fighters. They would be seven in all. <a id="page_866"></a><span class="txit">It’s a good number,</span> he told himself. <span class="txit">A number of power</span>. He looked beyond them at the dust-cloud. It rose higher than any of the remaining seminon dust-devils, and was moving with horrible speed. Yet for the time being, Roland thought they were all right.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Listen and hear.” It was Zalia, Margaret, and Rosa to whom he was speaking. The members of his own ka-tet already knew this part, had since old Jamie whispered his long-held secret into Eddie’s ear on the Jaffordses’ porch. “The Wolves are neither men nor monsters; they’re robots.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Robots!”</span> Overholser shouted, but with surprise rather than disbelief.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aye, and of a kind my ka-tet has seen before,” Roland said. He was thinking of a certain clearing where the great bear’s final surviving retainers had chased each other in an endless worry-circle. “They wear hoods to conceal tiny twirling things on top of their heads. They’re probably this wide and this long.” Roland showed them a height of about two inches and a length of about five. “It’s what Molly Doolin hit and snapped off with her dish, once upon a time. She hit by accident. We’ll hit a-purpose.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Thinking-caps,” Eddie said. “Their connection to the outside world. Without em, they’re as dead as dogshit.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aim here.” Roland held his right hand an inch above the crown of his head.</p>

  <p class="indent">“But the chests . . . the gills in the chests . . . ” Margaret began, sounding utterly bewildered.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Bullshit now and ever was,” Roland said. “Aim at the tops of the hoods.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_867"></a>“Someday,” Tian said, “I’m going to know why there had to be so much buggering bullshit.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I hope there <span class="txit">is</span> a someday,” Roland said. The last of the children—the youngest ones—were just starting up the path, obediently holding hands. The eldest would be perhaps an eighth of a mile up, Jake’s quartet at least an eighth of a mile beyond that. It would have to be enough. Roland turned his attention to the child-minders.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Now they come back,” he said. “Take them across the ditch and through the corn in two side-by-side rows.” He cocked a thumb over his shoulder without looking. “Do I have to tell you how important it is that the corn-plants not be disturbed, especially close to the road, where the Wolves can see?”</p>

  <p class="indent">They shook their heads.</p>

  <p class="indent">“At the edge of the rice,” Roland continued, “take them into one of the streams. Lead them almost to the river, then have them lie down where it’s tall and still green.” He moved his hands apart, his blue eyes blazing. “Spread em out. You grown-ups get on the river side of em. If there’s trouble—more Wolves, something else we don’t expect—that’s the side it’ll come from.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Without giving them a chance to ask questions, Roland buried his fingers in the corners of his mouth again and whistled. Vaughn Eisenhart, Krella Anselm, and Wayne Overholser joined the others in the ditch and began bellowing for the little ’uns to turn around and start back toward the road. Eddie, meanwhile, took another look over his shoulder and was stunned to see how far toward the river the dust-cloud had progressed. Such rapid <a id="page_868"></a>movement made perfect sense once you knew the secret; those gray horses weren’t horses at all, but mechanical conveyances disguised to <span class="txit">look</span> like horses, no more than that. <span class="txit">Like a fleet of government Chevys,</span> he thought.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Roland, they’re coming fast! Like hell!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland looked. “We’re all right,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Are you sure?” Rosa asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The youngest children were now hurrying back across the road, hand-in-hand, bug-eyed with fear and excitement. Cantab of the Manni and Ara, his wife, were leading them. She told them to walk straight down the middle of the rows and try not to even brush any of the skeletal plants.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Why, sai?” asked one tyke, surely no older than four. There was a suspicious dark patch on the front of his overalls. “Corn all picked, see.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s a game,” Cantab said. “A don’t-touch-the-corn game.” He began to sing. Some of the children joined in, but most were too bewildered and frightened.</p>

  <p class="indent">As the pairs crossed the road, growing taller and older as they came, Roland cast another glance to the east. He estimated the Wolves were still ten minutes from the other side of the Whye, and ten minutes should be enough, but gods, they were <span class="txit">fast</span>! It had already crossed his mind that he might have to keep Slightman the Younger and the Tavery twins up here, with them. It wasn’t in the plan, but by the time things got this far, the plan almost always started to change. <span class="txit">Had</span> to change.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now the last of the kids were crossing, and only <a id="page_869"></a>Overholser, Callahan, Slightman the Elder, and Sarey Adams were still on the road.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Go,” Roland told them.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I want to wait for my boy!” Slightman objected.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Go!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman looked disposed to argue the point, but Sarey Adams touched one elbow and Overholser actually took hold of the other.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Come’ee,” Overholser said. “The man’ll take care of yours same as he’ll take care of his.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman gave Roland a final doubtful look, then stepped over the ditch and began herding the tail end of the line downhill, along with Overholser and Sarey.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Susannah, show them the hide,” Roland said.</p>

  <p class="indent">They’d been careful to make sure the kids crossed the ditch on the road’s river side well down from where they had done their digging the day before. Now, using one of her capped and shortened legs, Susannah kicked aside a tangle of leaves, branches, and dead corn-plants—the sort of thing one would expect to see left behind in a roadside runoff ditch—and exposed a dark hole.</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s just a trench,” she said, almost apologetically. “There’s boards over the top. Light ones, easy to push back. That’s where we’ll be. Roland’s made a . . . oh, I don’t know what you call it, we call it a periscope where I come from, a thing with mirrors inside it you can see through . . . and when the time comes, we just stand up. The boards’ll fall away around us when we do.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Where’s Jake and those other three?” Eddie asked. “They should be back by now.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_870"></a>“It’s too soon,” Roland said. “Calm down, Eddie.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I won’t calm down and it’s <span class="txit">not</span> too soon. We should at least be able to see them. I’m going over there—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No, you’re not,” Roland said. “We have to get as many as we can before they figure out what’s going on. That means keeping our firepower over here, at their backs.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Roland, something’s not right.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland ignored him. “Lady-sais, slide in there, do ya please. The extra boxes of plates will be on your end; we’ll just kick some leaves over them.”</p>

  <p class="indent">He looked across the road as Zalia, Rosa, and Margaret began to worm into the hole Susannah had disclosed. The path to the arroyo was now completely empty. There was still no sign of Jake, Benny, and the Tavery twins. He was beginning to think that Eddie was right; that something had gone amiss.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">SIX</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Jake and his companions reached the place where the trail split quickly and without incident. Jake had held back two items, and when they reached the fork, he threw a broken rattle toward the Gloria and a little girl’s woven string bracelet toward the Redbird. <span class="txit">Choose,</span> he thought, <span class="txit">and be damned to you either way.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">When he turned, he saw the Tavery twins had already started back. Benny was waiting for him, his face pale and his eyes shining. Jake nodded to him and made himself return Benny’s smile. “Let’s go,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_871"></a>Then they heard Roland’s whistle and the twins broke into a run, despite the scree and fallen rock which littered the path. They were still holding hands, weaving their way around what they couldn’t simply scramble over.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Hey, don’t run!” Jake shouted. “He said not to run and mind your f—”</p>

  <p class="indent">That was when Frank Tavery stepped into the hole. Jake heard the grinding, snapping sound his ankle made when it broke, knew from the horrified wince on Benny’s face that he had, too. Then Frank let out a low, screaming moan and pitched sideways. Francine grabbed for him and got a hand on his upper arm, but the boy was too heavy. He fell through her grip like a sashweight. The thud of his skull colliding with the granite outcrop beside him was far louder than the sound his ankle had made. The blood which immediately began to flow from the wound in his scalp was brilliant in the early morning light.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Trouble,</span> Jake thought. <span class="txit">And in our road.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Benny was gaping, his cheeks the color of cottage cheese. Francine was already kneeling beside her brother, who lay at a twisted, ugly angle with his foot still caught in the hole. She was making high, breathless keening sounds. Then, all at once, the keening stopped. Her eyes rolled up in their sockets and she pitched forward over her unconscious twin brother in a dead faint.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Come on,” Jake said, and when Benny only stood there, gawping, Jake punched him in the shoulder. “For your father’s sake!”</p>

  <p class="indent">That got Benny moving.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><a class="calibre2" id="page_872"></a><span class="smallcaps1">SEVEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Jake saw everything with a gunslinger’s cold, clear vision. The blood splashed on the rock. The clump of hair stuck in it. The foot in the hole. The spittle on Frank Tavery’s lips. The swell of his sister’s new breast as she lay awkwardly across him. The Wolves were coming now. It wasn’t Roland’s whistle that told him this, but the touch. <span class="txit">Eddie,</span> he thought. <span class="txit">Eddie wants to come over here.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Jake had never tried using the touch to send, but he did now: <span class="txit">Stay where you are! If we can’t get back in time we’ll try to hide while they go past BUT DON’T YOU COME DOWN HERE! DON’T YOU SPOIL THINGS!</span></p>

  <p class="indent">He had no idea if the message got through, but he <span class="txit">did</span> know it was all he had time for. Meanwhile, Benny was . . . what? What was <span class="txit">le mot juste</span>? Ms. Avery back at Piper had been very big on <span class="txit">le mot juste</span>. And it came to him. Gibbering. Benny was gibbering.</p>

  <p class="indent">“What are we gonna do, Jake? Man Jesus, <span class="txit">both</span> of them! They were fine! Just running, and then . . . what if the Wolves come? What if they come while we’re still here? We better leave em, don’t you think?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“We’re not leaving them,” Jake said. He leaned down and grabbed Francine Tavery by the shoulders. He yanked her into a sitting position, mostly to get her off her brother so Frank could breathe. Her head lolled back, her hair streaming like dark silk. Her eyelids fluttered, showing glabrous white beneath. Without thinking, Jake slapped her. And hard.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_873"></a>“Ow! <span class="txit">Ow!”</span> Her eyes flew open, blue and beautiful and shocked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Get up!” Jake shouted. “Get off him!”</p>

  <p class="indent">How much time had passed? How still everything was, now that the children had gone back to the road! Not a single bird cried out, not even a rustie. He waited for Roland to whistle again, but Roland didn’t. And really, why would he? They were on their own now.</p>

  <p class="indent">Francine rolled aside, then staggered to her feet. “Help him . . . please, sai, I beg . . . ”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Benny. We have to get his foot out of the hole.” Benny dropped to one knee on the other side of the awkwardly sprawled boy. His face was still pale, but his lips were pressed together in a tight straight line that Jake found encouraging. “Take his shoulder.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Benny grasped Frank Tavery’s right shoulder. Jake took the left. Their eyes met across the unconscious boy’s body. Jake nodded.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Now.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">They pulled together. Frank Tavery’s eyes flew open—they were as blue and as beautiful as his sister’s—and he uttered a scream so high it was soundless. But his foot did not come free.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was stuck deep.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">EIGHT</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Now a gray-green shape was resolving itself out of the dust-cloud and they could hear the drumming of many hooves on hardpan. The three Calla women were in the hide. Only Roland, Eddie, and Susannah still remained in the ditch, the men standing, <a id="page_874"></a>Susannah kneeling with her strong thighs spread. They stared across the road and up the arroyo path. The path was still empty.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I heard something,” Susannah said. “I think one of em’s hurt.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Fuck it, Roland, I’m going after them,” Eddie said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Is that what Jake wants or what <span class="txit">you</span> want?” Roland asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">Eddie flushed. He had heard Jake in his head—not the exact words, but the gist—and he supposed Roland had, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">“There’s a hundred kids down there and only four over there,” Roland said. “Get under cover, Eddie. You too, Susannah.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“What about you?” Eddie asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland pulled in a deep breath, let it out. “I’ll help if I can.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You’re not going after him, are you?” Eddie looked at Roland with mounting disbelief. “You’re really not.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland glanced toward the dust-cloud and the gray-green cluster beneath it, which would resolve itself into individual horses and riders in less than a minute. Riders with snarling wolf faces framed in green hoods. They weren’t riding toward the river so much as they were swooping down on it.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No,” Roland said. “Can’t. Get under cover.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Eddie stood where he was a moment longer, hand on the butt of the big revolver, pale face working. Then, without a word, he turned from Roland and grasped Susannah’s arm. He knelt beside her, then slid into the hole. Now there was only Roland, the big revolver slung low on his left hip, looking across the road at the empty arroyo path.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><a class="calibre2" id="page_875"></a><span class="smallcaps1">NINE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Benny Slightman was a well-built lad, but he couldn’t move the chunk of rock holding the Tavery boy’s foot. Jake saw that on the first pull. His mind (his cold, cold mind) tried to judge the weight of the imprisoned boy against the weight of the imprisoning stone. He guessed the stone weighed more.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Francine.”</p>

  <p class="indent">She looked at him from eyes which were now wet and a little blinded by shock.</p>

  <p class="indent">“You love him?” Jake asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aye, with all my heart!”</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">He</span> is <span class="txit">your heart,</span> Jake thought. <span class="txit">Good</span>. “Then help us. Pull him as hard as you can when I say. Never mind if he screams, pull him anyway.”</p>

  <p class="indent">She nodded as if she understood. Jake hoped she did.</p>

  <p class="indent">“If we can’t get him out this time, we’ll have to leave him.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I’ll <span class="txit">never</span>!” she shouted.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was no time for argument. Jake joined Benny beside the flat white rock. Beyond its jagged edge, Frank’s bloody shin disappeared into a black hole. The boy was fully awake now, and gasping. His left eye rolled in terror. The right one was buried in a sheet of blood. A flap of scalp was hanging over his ear.</p>

  <p class="indent">“We’re going to lift the rock and you’re going to pull him out,” Jake told Francine. “On three. You ready?”</p>

  <p class="indent">When she nodded, her hair fell across her face in a curtain. She made no attempt to get it out <a id="page_876"></a>of the way, only seized her brother beneath the armpits.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Francie, don’t hurt me,” he moaned.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Shut up,” she said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“One,” Jake said. “You pull this fucker, Benny, even if it pops your balls. You hear me?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yer-bugger, just <span class="txit">count</span>.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Two. <span class="txit">Three</span>.”</p>

  <p class="indent">They pulled, crying out at the strain. The rock moved. Francine yanked her brother backward with all her force, also crying out.</p>

  <p class="indent">Frank Tavery’s scream as his foot came free was loudest of all.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Roland heard hoarse cries of effort, overtopped by a scream of pure agony. Something had happened over there, and Jake had done something about it. The question was, had it been enough to put right whatever had gone wrong?</p>

  <p class="indent">Spray flew in the morning light as the Wolves plunged into the Whye and began galloping across on their gray horses. Roland could see them clearly now, coming in waves of five and six, spurring their mounts. He put the number at sixty. On the far side of the river, they’d disappear beneath the shoulder of a grass-covered bluff. Then they’d reappear, less than a mile away. They would disappear one last time, behind one final hill—all of them, if they stayed bunched up as they were now—and that would be the last chance for Jake to come, for all of them to get under cover.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_877"></a>He stared up the path, willing the children to appear—willing <span class="txit">Jake</span> to appear—but the path remained empty.</p>

  <p class="indent">Wolves streaming up the west bank of the river now, their horses casting off showers of droplets which glittered in the morning sun like gold. Clods of earth and sprays of sand flew. Now the hoofbeats were an approaching thunder.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">ELEVEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Jake took one shoulder, Benny the other. They carried Frank Tavery down the path that way, plunging ahead with reckless speed, hardly even looking down at the tumbles of rock. Francine ran just behind them.</p>

  <p class="indent">They came around the final curve, and Jake felt a surge of gladness when he saw Roland in the ditch opposite, still Roland, standing watch with his good left hand on the butt of his gun and his hat tipped back from his brow.</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s my brother!” Francine was shouting at him. “He fell down! He got his foot caught in a hole!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland suddenly dropped out of sight.</p>

  <p class="indent">Francine looked around, not frightened, exactly, but uncomprehending. “What—?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Wait,” Jake said, because that was all he knew to say. He had no other ideas. If that was true of the gunslinger as well, they’d probably die here.</p>

  <p class="indent">“My ankle . . . burning,” Frank Tavery gasped.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Shut up,” Jake said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Benny laughed. It was shock-laughter, but it was <a id="page_878"></a>also real laughter. Jake looked at him around the sobbing, bleeding Frank Tavery . . . and winked. Benny winked back. And, just like that, they were friends again.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TWELVE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">As she lay in the darkness of the hide with Eddie on her left and the acrid smell of leaves in her nose, Susannah felt a sudden cramp seize her belly. She had just time to register it before an icepick of pain, blue and savage, plunged into the left side of her brain, seeming to numb that entire side of her face and neck. At the same instant the image of a great banquet hall filled her mind: steaming roasts, stuffed fish, smoking steaks, magnums of champagne, frigates filled with gravy, rivers of red wine. She heard a piano, and a singing voice. That voice was charged with an awful sadness. “Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my li-iife tonight,” it sang.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">No!</span> Susannah cried to the force that was trying to engulf her. And did that force have a name? Of course it did. Its name was Mother, its hand was the one that rocked the cradle, and the hand that rocks the cradle rules the w—</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">No! You have to let me finish this! Afterward, if you want to have it, I’ll help you! I’ll help you have it! But if you try to force this on me now, I’ll fight you tooth and nail! And if it comes to getting myself killed, and killing your precious chap along with me, I’ll do it! Do you hear me, you bitch?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">For a moment there was nothing but the darkness, the press of Eddie’s leg, the numbness in the <a id="page_879"></a>left side of her face, the thunder of the oncoming horses, the acrid smell of the leaves, and the sound of the Sisters breathing, getting ready for their own battle. Then, each of her words articulated clearly from a place above and behind Susannah’s left eye, Mia for the first time spoke to her.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Fight your fight, woman. I’ll even help, if I can. And then keep your promise.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">“Susannah?” Eddie murmured from beside her. “Are you all right?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” she said. And she was. The icepick was gone. The voice was gone. So was the terrible numbness. But close by, Mia was waiting.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">THIRTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Roland lay on his belly in the ditch, now watching the Wolves with one eye of imagination and one of intuition instead of with those in his head. The Wolves were between the bluff and the hill, riding full-out with their cloaks streaming behind them. They’d all disappear behind the hill for perhaps seven seconds. <span class="txit">If,</span> that was, they stayed bunched together and the leaders didn’t start to pull ahead. <span class="txit">If</span> he had calculated their speed correctly. <span class="txit">If</span> he was right, he’d have five seconds when he could motion Jake and the others to come. Or seven. <span class="txit">If</span> he was right, they’d have those same five seconds to cross the road. If he was wrong (or if the others were slow), the Wolves would either see the man in the ditch, the children in the road, or all of them. The distances would likely be too great to use their weapons, but that wouldn’t much matter, because the carefully crafted ambush would be blown. The <a id="page_880"></a>smart thing would be to stay down, and leave the kids over there to their fate. Hell, four kids caught on the arroyo path would make the Wolves more sure than ever that the rest of them were stashed farther on, in one of the old mines.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Enough thinking,</span> Cort said in his head. <span class="txit">If you mean to move, maggot, this is your only chance.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Roland shot to his feet. Directly across from him, protected by the cluster of tumbled boulders which marked the East Road end of the arroyo path, stood Jake and Benny Slightman, with the Tavery boy supported between them. The kid was bloody both north and south; gods knew what had happened to him. His sister was looking over his shoulder. In that instant they looked not just like twins but Kaffin twins, joined at the body.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland jerked both hands extravagantly back over his head, as if clawing for a grip in the air: <span class="txit">To me, come! Come!</span> At the same time, he looked east. No sign of the Wolves; good. The hill <span class="txit">had</span> momentarily blocked them all.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake and Benny sprinted across the road, still dragging the boy between them. Frank Tavery’s shor’boots dug fresh grooves in the oggan. Roland could only hope the Wolves would attach no especial significance to the marks.</p>

  <p class="indent">The girl came last, light as a sprite. “Down!” Roland snarled, grabbing her shoulder and throwing her flat. “Down, down, <span class="txit">down</span>!” He landed beside her and Jake landed on top of him. Roland could feel the boy’s madly beating heart between his shoulderblades, through both of their shirts, and had a moment to relish the sensation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now the hoofbeats were coming hard and <a id="page_881"></a>strong, swelling every second. Had they been seen by the lead riders? It was impossible to know, but they <span class="txit">would</span> know, and soon. In the meantime they could only go on as planned. It would be tight quarters in the hide with three extra people in there, and if the Wolves had seen Jake and the other three crossing the road, they would all no doubt be cooked where they lay without a single shot fired or plate thrown, but there was no time to worry about that now. They had a minute left at most, Roland estimated, maybe only forty seconds, and that last little bit of time was melting away beneath them.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Get off me and under cover,” he said to Jake. “Right now.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The weight disappeared. Jake slipped into the hide.</p>

  <p class="indent">“You’re next, Frank Tavery,” Roland said. “And be quiet. Two minutes from now you can scream all you want, but for now, keep your mouth shut. That goes for all of you.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I’ll be quiet,” the boy said huskily. Benny and Frank’s sister nodded.</p>

  <p class="indent">“We’re going to stand up at some point and start shooting,” Roland said. “You three—Frank, Francine, Benny—stay down. Stay flat.” He paused. “For your lives, <span class="txit">stay out of our way</span>.”</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">FOURTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Roland lay in the leaf- and dirt-smelling dark, listening to the harsh breathing of the children on his left. This sound was soon overwhelmed by that of approaching hooves. The eye of imagination <a id="page_882"></a>and that of intuition opened once more, and wider than ever. In no more than thirty seconds—perhaps as few as fifteen—the red rage of battle would do away with all but the most primitive seeing, but for now he saw all, and all he saw was exactly as he wanted it to be. And why not? What good did visualizing plans gone astray ever do anyone?</p>

  <p class="indent">He saw the twins of the Calla lying sprawled like corpses in the thickest, wettest part of the rice, with the muck oozing through their shirts and pants. He saw the adults beyond them, almost to the place where rice became riverbank. He saw Sarey Adams with her plates, and Ara of the Manni—Cantab’s wife—with a few of her own, for Ara also threw (although as one of the Manni-folk, she could never be at fellowship with the other women). He saw a couple of the men—Estrada, Anselm, Overholser—with their bahs hugged to their chests. Instead of a bah, Vaughn Eisenhart was hugging the rifle Roland had cleaned for him. In the road, approaching from the east, he saw rank upon rank of green-cloaked riders on gray horses. They were slowing now. The sun was finally up and gleaming on the metal of their masks. The joke of those masks, of course, was that there was more metal beneath them. Roland let the eye of his imagining rise, looking for other riders—a party coming into the undefended town from the south, for instance. He saw none. In his own mind, at least, the entire raiding party was here. And if they’d swallowed the line Roland and the Ka-Tet of the Ninety and Nine had paid out with such care, it <span class="txit">should</span> be here. He saw the bucka waggons lined up on the town side of the road <a id="page_883"></a>and had time to wish they’d freed the teams from the traces, but of course this way it looked better, more hurried. He saw the path leading into the arroyos, to the mines both abandoned and working, to the honeycomb of caves beyond them. He saw the leading Wolves rein up here, dragging the mouths of their mounts into snarls with their gauntleted hands. He saw through their eyes, saw pictures not made of warm human sight but cold, like those in the Magda-seens. Saw the child’s hat Francine Tavery had let drop. His mind had a nose as well as an eye, and it smelled the bland yet fecund aroma of children. It smelled something rich and fatty—the stuff the Wolves would take from the children they abducted. His mind had an ear as well as a nose, and it heard—faintly—the same sort of clicks and clunks that had emanated from Andy, the same low whining of relays, servomotors, hydraulic pumps, gods knew what other machinery. His mind’s eye saw the Wolves first inspecting the confusion of tracks on the road (he <span class="txit">hoped</span> it looked like a confusion to them), then looking up the arroyo path. Because imagining them looking the other way, getting ready to broil the ten of them in their hide like chickens in a roasting pan, would do him no good. No, they were looking up the arroyo path. <span class="txit">Must</span> be looking up the arroyo path. They were smelling children—perhaps their fear as well as the powerful stuff buried deep in their brains—and seeing the few tumbled bits of trash and treasure their prey had left behind. Standing there on their mechanical horses. Looking.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Go in,</span> Roland urged silently. He felt Jake stir a little <a id="page_884"></a>beside him, hearing his thought. His prayer, almost. <span class="txit">Go in. Go after them. Take what you will</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was a loud <span class="txit">clack!</span> sound from one of the Wolves. This was followed by a brief blurt of siren. The siren was followed by the nasty warbling whistle Jake had heard out at the Dogan. After that, the horses began to move again. First there was the soft thud of their hooves on the oggan, then on the far stonier ground of the arroyo path. There was nothing else; these horses didn’t whinny nervously, like those still harnessed to the buckas. For Roland, it was enough. They had taken the bait. He slipped his revolver out of its holster. Beside him, Jake shifted again and Roland knew he was doing the same thing.</p>

  <p class="indent">He had told them the formation to expect when they burst out of the hide: about a quarter of the Wolves on one side of the path, looking toward the river, a quarter of their number turned toward the town of Calla Bryn Sturgis. Or perhaps a few more in that direction, since if there was trouble, the town was where the Wolves—or the Wolves’ programmers—would reasonably expect it to come from. And the rest? Thirty or more? Already up the path. Hemmed in, do ya.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland began counting to twenty, but when he got to nineteen decided he’d counted enough. He gathered his legs beneath him—there was no dry twist now, not so much as a twinge—and then pistoned upward with his father’s gun held high in his hand.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“For Gilead and the Calla!”</span> he roared. <span class="txit">“Now, gunslingers! Now, you Sisters of Oriza! Now, now! Kill them! No quarter! Kill them all!”</span></p>

  <h3 class="h2"><a class="calibre2" id="page_885"></a><span class="smallcaps1">FIFTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">They burst up and out of the earth like dragon’s teeth. Boards flew away to either side of them, along with dry flurries of weeds and leaves. Roland and Eddie each had one of the big revolvers with the sandalwood grips. Jake had his father’s Ruger. Margaret, Rosa, and Zalia each held a Riza. Susannah had two, her arms crossed over her breasts as though she were cold.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Wolves were deployed exactly as Roland had seen them with the cool killer’s eye of his imagination, and he felt a moment of triumph before all lesser thought and emotion was swept away beneath the red curtain. As always, he was never so happy to be alive as when he was preparing to deal death. <span class="txit">Five minutes’ worth of blood and stupidity,</span> he’d told them, and here those five minutes were. He’d also told them he always felt sick afterward, and while that was true enough, he never felt so fine as he did at this moment of beginning; never felt so completely and truly himself. Here were the tag ends of glory’s old cloud. It didn’t matter that they were robots; gods, no! What mattered was that they had been preying on the helpless for generations, and this time they had been caught utterly and completely by surprise.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Top of the hoods!”</span> Eddie screamed, as in his right hand Roland’s pistol began to thunder and spit fire. The harnessed horses and mules reared in the traces; a couple screamed in surprise. <span class="txit">“Top of the hoods, get the thinking-caps!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">And, as if to demonstrate his point, the green hoods of three riders to the right of the path <a id="page_886"></a>twitched as if plucked by invisible fingers. Each of the three beneath pitched bonelessly out of their saddles and struck the ground. In Gran-pere’s story of the Wolf Molly Doolin had brought down, there had been a good deal of twitching afterward, but these three lay under the feet of their prancing horses as still as stones. Molly might not have hit the hidden “thinking-cap” cleanly, but Eddie knew what he was shooting for, and had.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland also began to fire, shooting from the hip, shooting almost casually, but each bullet found its mark. He was after the ones on the path, wanting to pile up bodies there, to make a barricade if he could.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Riza flies true!”</span> Rosalita Munoz shrieked. The plate she was holding left her hand and bolted across the East Road with an unremitting rising shriek. It clipped through the hood of a rider at the head of the arroyo path who was trying desperately to rein his horse around. The thing fell backward, feet up to heaven, and landed upside down with its boots in the road.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Riza!”</span> That was Margaret Eisenhart.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“For my brother!”</span> Zalia cried.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Lady Riza come for your asses, you bastards!”</span> Susannah uncrossed her arms and threw both plates outward. They flew, screaming, crisscrossed in midair, and both found their mark. Scraps of green hooding fluttered down; the Wolves to whom the hoods had belonged fell faster and harder.</p>

  <p class="indent">Bright rods of fire now glowed in the morning light as the jostling, struggling riders on either side of the path unsheathed their energy weapons. Jake <a id="page_887"></a>shot the thinking-cap of the first one to unsheath and it fell on its own bitterly sizzling sword, catching its cloak afire. Its horse shied sideways, into the descending light-stick of the rider to the direct left. Its head came off, disclosing a nest of sparks and wires. Now the sirens began to blat steadily, burglar alarms in hell.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland had thought the Wolves closest to town might try to break off and flee toward the Calla. Instead the nine on that side still left—Eddie had taken six with his first six shots—spurred past the buckas and directly toward them. Two or three hurled humming silvery balls.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Eddie! Jake! Sneetches! Your right!”</p>

  <p class="indent">They swung in that direction immediately, leaving the women, who were hurling plates as fast as they could pull them from their silk-lined bags. Jake was standing with his legs spread and the Ruger held out in his right hand, his left bracing his right wrist. His hair was blowing back from his brow. He was wide-eyed and handsome, smiling. He squeezed off three quick shots, each one a whipcrack in the morning air. He had a vague, distant memory of the day in the woods when he had shot pottery out of the sky. Now he was shooting at something far more dangerous, and he was glad. <span class="txit">Glad</span>. The first three of the flying balls exploded in brilliant flashes of bluish light. A fourth jinked, then zipped straight at him. Jake ducked and heard it pass just above his head, humming like some sort of pissed-off toaster oven. It would turn, he knew, and come back.</p>

  <p class="indent">Before it could, Susannah swiveled and fired a <a id="page_888"></a>plate at it. The plate flew straight to the mark, howling. When it struck, both it and the sneetch exploded. Sharpnel rained down in the corn-plants, setting some of them alight.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland reloaded, the smoking barrel of his revolver momentarily pointed down between his feet. Beyond Jake, Eddie was doing the same.</p>

  <p class="indent">A Wolf jumped the tangled heap of bodies at the head of the arroyo path, its green cloak floating out behind it, and one of Rosa’s plates tore back its hood, for a moment revealing the radar dish beneath. The thinking caps of the bear’s retinue had been moving slowly and jerkily; this one was spinning so fast its shape was only a metallic blur. Then it was gone and the Wolf went tumbling to the side and onto the team which had drawn Overholser’s lead waggon. The horses flinched backward, shoving the bucka into the one behind, mashing four whinnying, rearing animals between. These tried to bolt but had nowhere to go. Overholser’s bucka teetered, then overturned. The downed Wolf’s horse gained the road, stumbled over the body of another Wolf lying there, and went sprawling in the dust, one of its legs jutting off crookedly to the side.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland’s mind was gone; his eye saw everything. He was reloaded. The Wolves who had gone up the path were pinned behind a tangled heap of bodies, just as he had hoped. The group of fifteen on the town side had been decimated, only two left. Those on the right were trying to flank the end of the ditch, where the three Sisters of Oriza and Susannah anchored their line. Roland left the remaining two Wolves on his side to Eddie and Jake, sprinted <a id="page_889"></a>down the trench to stand behind Susannah, and began firing at the ten remaining Wolves bearing down on them. One raised a sneetch to throw, then dropped it as Roland’s bullet snapped off its thinking-cap. Rosa took another one, Margaret Eisenhart a third.</p>

  <p class="indent">Margaret dipped to get another plate. When she stood up again, a light-stick swept off her head, setting her hair on fire as it tumbled into the ditch. And Benny’s reaction was understandable; she had been almost a second mother to him. When the burning head landed beside him, he batted it aside and scrambled out of the ditch, blind with panic, howling in terror.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Benny, no, get back!”</span> Jake cried.</p>

  <p class="indent">Two of the remaining Wolves threw their silver deathballs at the crawling, screaming boy. Jake shot one out of the air. He never had a chance at the other. It struck Benny Slightman in the chest and the boy simply exploded outward, one arm tearing free of his body and landing palm-up in the road.</p>

  <p class="indent">Susannah cut the thinking-cap off the Wolf which had killed Margaret with one plate, then did for the one who had killed Jake’s friend with another. She pulled two fresh Rizas from her sacks and turned back to the oncoming Wolves just as the first one leaped into the ditch, its horse’s chest knocking Roland asprawl. It brandished its sword over the gunslinger. To Susannah it looked like a brilliant red-orange tube of neon.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“No you don’t, muhfuh!”</span> she screamed, and slung the plate in her right hand. It sheared through the gleaming saber and the weapon simply exploded <a id="page_890"></a>at the hilt, tearing off the Wolf’s arm. The next moment one of Rosa’s plates amputated its thinking-cap and it tumbled sideways and crashed to the ground, its gleaming mask grinning at the paralyzed, terrified Tavery twins, who lay clinging to each other. A moment later it began to smoke and melt.</p>

  <p class="indent">Shrieking Benny’s name, Jake walked across the East Road, reloading the Ruger as he went, tracking through his dead friend’s blood without realizing it. To his left, Roland, Susannah, and Rosa were putting paid to the five remaining Wolves in what had been the raiding party’s north wing. The raiders whirled their horses in jerky, useless circles, seeming unsure what to do in circumstances such as these.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Want some company, kid?” Eddie asked him. On their right, the group of Wolves who had been stationed on the town side of the arroyo path all lay dead. Only one of them had actually made it as far as the ditch; that one lay with its hooded head plowed into the freshly turned earth of the hide and its booted feet in the road. The rest of its body was wrapped in its green cloak. It looked like a bug that has died in its cocoon.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Sure,” Jake said. Was he talking or only thinking? He didn’t know. The sirens blasted the air. “Whatever you want. They killed Benny.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I know. That sucks.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“It should have been his fucking <span class="txit">father,</span>” Jake said. Was he crying? He didn’t know.</p>

  <p class="indentb">“Agreed. Have a present.” Into Jake’s hand Eddie dropped a couple of balls about three inches in diameter. The surfaces looked like steel, but <a id="page_891"></a>when Jake squeezed, he felt some give—it was like squeezing a child’s toy made out of hard, hard rubber. A small plate on the side read</p>

  <div class="sidebar">
    <p class="center">“SNEETCH”</p>

    <p class="center">HARRY POTTER MODEL</p>

    <p class="centera">Serial # 465-11-AA HPJKR</p>

    <p class="centera">CAUTION</p>

    <p class="center">EXPLOSIVE</p>
  </div>

  <p class="indent">To the left of the plate was a button. A distant part of Jake’s mind wondered who Harry Potter was. The sneetch’s inventor, more than likely.</p>

  <p class="indent">They reached the heap of dead Wolves at the head of the arroyo path. Perhaps machines couldn’t really be dead, but Jake was unable to think of them as anything else, tumbled and tangled as they were. Dead, yes. And he was savagely glad. From behind them came an explosion, followed by a shriek of either extreme pain or extreme pleasure. For the moment Jake didn’t care which. All his attention was focused on the remaining Wolves trapped on the arroyo path. There were somewhere between eighteen and two dozen of them.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was one Wolf out in front, its sizzling fire-stick raised. It was half-turned to its mates, and now it waved its light-stick at the road. <span class="txit">Except that’s no light-stick,</span> Eddie thought. <span class="txit">That’s a light</span>-saber, <span class="txit">just like the ones in the</span> Star Wars <span class="txit">movies. Only these light-sabers aren’t special effects</span>—<span class="txit">they really kill. What the hell’s going on here?</span> Well, the guy out front <a id="page_892"></a>was trying to rally his troops, that much seemed clear. Eddie decided to cut the sermon short. He thumbed the button in one of the three sneetches he had kept for himself. The thing began to hum and vibrate in his hand. It was sort of like holding a joy-buzzer.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Hey, Sunshine!” he called.</p>

  <p class="indent">The head Wolf didn’t look around and so Eddie simply lobbed the sneetch at it. Thrown as easily as it was, it should have struck the ground twenty or thirty yards from the cluster of remaining Wolves and rolled to a stop. It picked up speed instead, rose, and struck the head Wolf dead center in its frozen snarl of a mouth. The thing exploded from the neck up, thinking-cap and all.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Go on,” Eddie said. “Try it. Using their own shit against em has its own special pl—”</p>

  <p class="indent">Ignoring him, Jake dropped the sneetches Eddie had given him, stumbled over the heap of bodies, and started up the path.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Jake? Jake, I don’t think that’s such a good idea—”</p>

  <p class="indent">A hand gripped Eddie’s upper arm. He whirled, raising his gun, then lowering it again when he saw Roland. “He can’t hear you,” the gunslinger said. “Come on. We’ll stand with him.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Wait, Roland, wait.” It was Rosa. She was smeared with blood, and Eddie assumed it was poor sai Eisenhart’s. He could see no wound on Rosa herself. “I want some of this,” she said.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><a class="calibre2" id="page_893"></a><span class="smallcaps1">SIXTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">They reached Jake just as the remaining Wolves made their last charge. A few threw sneetches. These Roland and Eddie picked out of the air easily. Jake fired the Ruger in nine steady, spaced shots, right wrist clasped in left hand, and each time he fired, one of the Wolves either flipped backward out of its saddle or went sliding over the side to be trampled by the horses coming behind. When the Ruger was empty, Rosa took a tenth, screaming Lady Oriza’s name. Zalia Jaffords had also joined them, and the eleventh fell to her.</p>

  <p class="indent">While Jake reloaded the Ruger, Roland and Eddie, standing side by side, went to work. They almost certainly could have taken the remaining eight between them (it didn’t much surprise Eddie that there had been nineteen in this last cluster), but they left the last two for Jake. As they approached, swinging their light-swords over their heads in a way that would have been undoubtedly terrifying to a bunch of farmers, the boy shot the thinking-cap off the one on the left. Then he stood aside, dodging as the last surviving Wolf took a halfhearted swing at him.</p>

  <p class="indent">Its horse leaped the pile of bodies at the end of the path. Susannah was on the far side of the road, sitting on her haunches amid a litter of fallen green-cloaked machinery and melting, rotting masks. She was also covered in Margaret Eisenhart’s blood.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland understood that Jake had left the final one for Susannah, who would have found it extremely <a id="page_894"></a>difficult to join them on the arroyo path because of her missing lower legs. The gunslinger nodded. The boy had seen a terrible thing this morning, suffered a terrible shock, but Roland thought he would be all right. Oy—waiting for them back at the Pere’s rectory-house—would no doubt help him through the worst of his grief.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Lady Oh-RIZA!”</span> Susannah screamed, and flung one final plate as the Wolf reined its horse around, turning it east, toward whatever it called home. The plate rose, screaming, and clipped off the top of the green hood. For a moment this last child thief sat in its saddle, shuddering and blaring out its alarm, calling for help that couldn’t come. Then it snapped violently backward, turning a complete somersault in midair, and thudded to the road. Its siren cut off in mid-whoop.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">And so,</span> Roland thought, <span class="txit">our five minutes are over</span>. He looked dully at the smoking barrel of his revolver, then dropped it back into its holster. One by one the alarms issuing from the downed robots were stopping.</p>

  <p class="indent">Zalia was looking at him with a kind of dazed incomprehension. “Roland!” she said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes, Zalia.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Are they gone? <span class="txit">Can</span> they be gone? Really?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“All gone,” Roland said. “I counted sixty-one, and they all lie here or on the road or in our ditch.”</p>

  <p class="indent">For a moment Tian’s wife only stood there, processing this information. Then she did something that surprised a man who was not often surprised. She threw herself against him, pressing her body frankly to his, and covered his face with hungry, <a id="page_895"></a>wet-lipped kisses. Roland bore this for a little bit, then held her away. The sickness was coming now. The feeling of uselessness. The sense that he would fight this battle or battles like it over and over for eternity, losing a finger to the lobstrosities here, perhaps an eye to a clever old witch there, and after each battle he would sense the Dark Tower a little farther away instead of a little closer. And all the time the dry twist would work its way in toward his heart.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Stop that,</span> he told himself. <span class="txit">It’s nonsense, and you know it.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">“Will they send more, Roland?” Rosa asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“They may have no more to send,” Roland said. “If they do, there’ll almost certainly be fewer of them. And now you know the secret to killing them, don’t you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” she said, and gave him a savage grin. Her eyes promised him more than kisses later on, if he’d have her.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Go down through the corn,” he told her. “You and Zalia both. Tell them it’s safe to come up now. Lady Oriza has stood friend to the Calla this day. And to the line of Eld, as well.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Will ye not come yourself?” Zalia asked him. She had stepped away from him, and her cheeks were filled with fire. “Will ye not come and let em cheer ye?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Perhaps later on we may all hear them cheer us,” Roland said. “Now we need to speak an-tet. The boy’s had a bad shock, ye ken.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” Rosa said. “Yes, all right. Come on, Zee.” She reached out and took Zalia’s hand. “Help me be the bearer of glad tidings.”</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><a class="calibre2" id="page_896"></a><span class="smallcaps1">SEVENTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">The two women crossed the road, making a wide berth around the tumbled, bloody remains of the poor Slightman lad. Zalia thought that most of what was left of him was only held together by his clothes, and shivered to think of the father’s grief.</p>

  <p class="indent">The young man’s shor’leg lady-sai was at the far north end of the ditch, examining the bodies of the Wolves scattered there. She found one where the little revolving thing hadn’t been entirely shot off, and was still trying to turn. The Wolf’s green-gloved hands shivered uncontrollably in the dust, as if with palsy. While Rosa and Zalia watched, Susannah picked up a largish chunk of rock and, cool as a night in Wide Earth, brought it down on the remains of the thinking-cap. The Wolf stilled immediately. The low hum that had been coming from it stopped.</p>

  <p class="indent">“We go to tell the others, Susannah,” Rosa said. “But first we want to tell thee well-done. How we do love thee, say true!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Zalia nodded. “We say thankya, Susannah of New York. We say thankya more big-big than could ever be told.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yar, say true,” Rosa agreed.</p>

  <p class="indent">The lady-sai looked up at them and smiled sweetly. For a moment Rosalita looked a little doubtful, as if maybe she saw something in that dark-brown face that she shouldn’t. Saw that Susannah Dean was no longer here, for instance. Then the expression of doubt was gone. “We go with good news, Susannah,” said she.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Wish you joy of it,” said Mia, daughter of <a id="page_897"></a>none. “Bring them back as you will. Tell them the danger here’s over, and let those who don’t believe count the dead.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“The legs of your pants are wet, do ya,” Zalia said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Mia nodded gravely. Another contraction had turned her belly to a stone, but she gave no sign. “ ’Tis blood, I’m afraid.” She nodded toward the headless body of the big rancher’s wife. “Hers.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The women started down through the corn, hand-in-hand. Mia watched Roland, Eddie, and Jake cross the road toward her. This would be the dangerous time, right here. Yet perhaps not too dangerous, after all; Susannah’s friends looked dazed in the aftermath of the battle. If she seemed a little off her feed, perhaps they would think the same of her.</p>

  <p class="indent">She thought mostly it would be a matter of waiting for her opportunity. Waiting . . . and then slipping away. In the meantime, she rode the contraction of her belly like a boat riding a high wave.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">They’ll know where you went,</span> a voice whispered. It wasn’t a head-voice but a belly-voice. The voice of the chap. And that voice spoke true.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Take the ball with you,</span> the voice told her. <span class="txit">Take it with you when you go. Leave them no door to follow you through.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Aye.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">EIGHTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">The Ruger cracked out a single shot and a horse died.</p>

  <p class="indent">From below the road, from the rice, came a rising roar of joy that was not quite disbelieving. Zalia <a id="page_898"></a>and Rosa had given their good news. Then a shrill cry of grief cut through the mingled voices of happiness. They had given the bad, as well.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake Chambers sat on the wheel of the overturned waggon. He had unharnessed the three horses that were okay. The fourth had been lying with two broken legs, foaming helplessly through its teeth and looking to the boy for help. The boy had given it. Now he sat staring at his dead friend. Benny’s blood was soaking into the road. The hand on the end of Benny’s arm lay palm-up, as if the dead boy wanted to shake hands with God. What God? According to current rumor, the top of the Dark Tower was empty.</p>

  <p class="indent">From Lady Oriza’s rice came a second scream of grief. Which had been Slightman, which Vaughn Eisenhart? At a distance, Jake thought, you couldn’t tell the rancher from the foreman, the employer from the employee. Was there a lesson there, or was it what Ms. Avery, back at good old Piper, would have called <span class="smallcaps">FEAR</span>, false evidence appearing real?</p>

  <p class="indent">The palm pointing up to the brightening sky, <span class="txit">that</span> was certainly real.</p>

  <p class="indentb">Now the <span class="txit">folken</span> began to sing. Jake recognized the song. It was a new version of the one Roland had sung on their first night in Calla Bryn Sturgis.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="txit">“Come-come-commala</span></p>

  <p class="center"><span class="txit">Rice come a-falla</span></p>

  <p class="center"><span class="txit">I-sissa ’ay a-bralla</span></p>

  <p class="center"><span class="txit">Dey come a-folla</span></p>

  <p class="center"><span class="txit">We went to a-rivva</span></p>

  <p class="center"><span class="txit">’Riza did us kivva . . . ”</span></p>

  <p class="indenta"><a id="page_899"></a>The rice swayed with the passage of the singing <span class="txit">folken,</span> swayed as if it were dancing for their joy, as Roland had danced for them that torchlit night. Some came with babbies in their arms, and even so burdened, they swayed from side to side. <span class="txit">We all danced this morning,</span> Jake thought. He didn’t know what he meant, only that it was a true thought. <span class="txit">The dance we do. The only one we know. Benny Slightman? Died dancing. Sai Eisenhart, too.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Roland and Eddie came over to him; Susannah, too, but she hung back a bit, as if deciding that, at least for the time being, the boys should be with the boys. Roland was smoking, and Jake nodded at it.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Roll me one of those, would you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland turned in Susannah’s direction, eyebrows raised. She shrugged, then nodded. Roland rolled Jake a cigarette, gave it to him, then scratched a match on the seat of his pants and lit it. Jake sat on the waggon wheel, taking the smoke in occasional puffs, holding it in his mouth, then letting it out. His mouth filled up with spit. He didn’t mind. Unlike some things, spit could be got rid of. He made no attempt to inhale.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland looked down the hill, where the first of the two running men was just entering the corn. “That’s Slightman,” he said. “Good.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Why good, Roland?” Eddie asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Because sai Slightman will have accusations to make,” Roland said. “In his grief, he isn’t going to care who hears them, or what his extraordinary knowledge might say about his part in this morning’s work.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Dance,” Jake said.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_900"></a>They turned to look at him. He sat pale and thoughtful on the waggon-wheel, holding his cigarette. “This morning’s dance,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland appeared to consider this, then nodded. “His part in this morning’s <span class="txit">dance</span>. If he gets here soon enough, we may be able to quiet him. If not, his son’s death is only going to be the start of Ben Slightman’s commala.”</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">NINETEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Slightman was almost fifteen years younger than the rancher, and arrived at the site of the battle well before the other. For a moment he only stood on the far edge of the hide, considering the shattered body lying in the road. There was not so much blood, now—the oggan had drunk it greedily—but the severed arm still lay where it had been, and the severed arm told all. Roland would no more have moved it before Slightman got here than he would have opened his flies and pissed on the boy’s corpse. Slightman the Younger had reached the clearing at the end of his path. His father, as next of kin, had a right to see where and how it had happened.</p>

  <p class="indent">The man stood quiet for perhaps five seconds, then pulled in a deep breath and let it out in a shriek. It chilled Eddie’s blood. He looked around for Susannah and saw she was no longer there. He didn’t blame her for ducking out. This was a bad scene. The worst.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman looked left, looked right, then looked straight ahead and saw Roland, standing beside the overturned waggon with his arms <a id="page_901"></a>crossed. Beside him, Jake still sat on the wheel, smoking his first cigarette.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“YOU!”</span> Slightman screamed. He was carrying his bah; now he unslung it. <span class="txit">“YOU DID THIS! YOU!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Eddie plucked the weapon deftly from Slightman’s hands. “No, you don’t, partner,” he murmured. “You don’t need this right now, why don’t you let me keep it for you.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman seemed not to notice. Incredibly, his right hand still made circular motions in the air, as if winding the bah for a shot.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“YOU KILLED MY SON! TO PAY ME BACK! YOU BASTARD! MURDERING BAS</span>—”</p>

  <p class="indent">Moving with the eerie, spooky speed that Eddie could still not completely believe, Roland seized Slightman around the neck in the crook of one arm, then yanked him forward. The move simultaneously cut off the flow of the man’s accusations and drew him close.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Listen to me,” Roland said, “and listen well. I care nothing for your life or honor, one’s been misspent and the other’s long gone, but your son is dead and about <span class="txit">his</span> honor I care very much. If you don’t shut up this second, you worm of creation, I’ll shut you up myself. So what would you? It’s nothing to me, either way. I’ll tell em you ran mad at the sight of him, stole my gun out of its holster, and put a bullet in your own head to join him. What would you have? Decide.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Eisenhart was badly blown but still lurching and weaving his way up through the corn, hoarsely calling his wife’s name: <span class="txit">“Margaret! Margaret! Answer me, dear! Gi’ me a word, I beg ya, do!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Roland let go of Slightman and looked at him <a id="page_902"></a>sternly. Slightman turned his awful eyes to Jake. “Did your dinh kill my boy in order to be revenged on me? Tell me the truth, soh.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake took a final puff on his cigarette and cast it away. The butt lay smoldering in the dirt next to the dead horse. “Did you even look at him?” he asked Benny’s Da’. “No bullet ever made could do that. Sai Eisenhart’s head fell almost on top of him and Benny crawled out of the ditch from the . . . the horror of it.” It was a word, he realized, that he had never used out loud. Had never <span class="txit">needed</span> to use out loud. “They threw two of their sneetches at him. I got one, but . . . ” He swallowed. There was a click in his throat. “The other . . . I would have, you ken . . . I tried, but . . . ” His face was working. His voice was breaking apart. Yet his eyes were dry. And somehow as terrible as Slightman’s. “I never had a chance at the other’n,” he finished, then lowered his head and began to sob.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland looked at Slightman, his eyebrows raised.</p>

  <p class="indent">“All right,” Slightman said. “I see how ’twas. Yar. Tell me, were he brave until then? Tell me, I beg.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“He and Jake brought back one of that pair,” Eddie said, gesturing to the Tavery twins. “The boy half. He got his foot caught in a hole. Jake and Benny pulled him out, then carried him. Nothing but guts, your boy. Side to side and all the way through the middle.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman nodded. He took the spectacles off his face and looked at them as if he had never seen them before. He held them so, before his eyes, for a second or two, then dropped them onto the road and crushed them beneath one bootheel. <a id="page_903"></a>He looked at Roland and Jake almost apologetically. “I believe I’ve seen all I need to,” he said, and then went to his son.</p>

  <p class="indent">Vaughn Eisenhart emerged from the corn. He saw his wife and gave a bellow. Then he tore open his shirt and began pounding his right fist above his flabby left breast, crying her name each time he did it.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oh, man,” Eddie said. “Roland, you ought to stop that.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Not I,” said the gunslinger.</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman took his son’s severed arm and planted a kiss in the palm with a tenderness Eddie found nearly unbearable. He put the arm on the boy’s chest, then walked back toward them. Without the glasses, his face looked naked and somehow unformed. “Jake, would you help me find a blanket?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake got off the waggon wheel to help him find what he needed. In the uncovered trench that had been the hide, Eisenhart was cradling his wife’s burnt head to his chest, rocking it. From the corn, approaching, came the children and their minders, singing “The Rice Song.” At first Eddie thought that what he was hearing from town must be an echo of that singing, and then he realized it was the rest of the Calla. They knew. They had heard the singing, and they knew. They were coming.</p>

  <p class="indent">Pere Callahan stepped out of the field with Lia Jaffords cradled in his arms. In spite of the noise, the little girl was asleep. Callahan looked at the heaps of dead Wolves, took one hand from beneath the little girl’s bottom, and drew a slow, trembling cross in the air.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_904"></a>“God be thanked,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland went to him and took the hand that had made the cross. “Put one on me,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Callahan looked at him, uncomprehending.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland nodded to Vaughn Eisenhart. “That one promised I’d leave town with his curse on me if harm came to his wife.”</p>

  <p class="indent">He could have said more, but there was no need. Callahan understood, and signed the cross on Roland’s brow. The fingernail trailed a warmth behind it that Roland felt a long time. And although Eisenhart never kept his promise, the gunslinger was never sorry that he’d asked the Pere for that extra bit of protection.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TWENTY</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">What followed was a confused jubilee there on the East Road, mingled with grief for the two who had fallen. Yet even the grief had a joyful light shining through it. No one seemed to feel that the losses were in any way equal to the gains. And Eddie supposed that was true. If it wasn’t your wife or your son who had fallen, that was.</p>

  <p class="indent">The singing from town drew closer. Now they could see rising dust. In the road, men and women embraced. Someone tried to take Margaret Eisenhart’s head away from her husband, who for the time being refused to let it go.</p>

  <p class="indent">Eddie drifted over to Jake.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Never saw <span class="txit">Star Wars,</span> did you?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No, told you. I was <span class="txit">going</span> to, but—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You left too soon. I know. Those things they were swinging—Jake, they were from that movie.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_905"></a>“You sure?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“<span class="txit">Yes</span>. And the Wolves . . . Jake, the Wolves themselves . . . ”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake was nodding, very slowly. Now they could see the people from town. The newcomers saw the children—<span class="txit">all</span> the children, still here and still safe—and raised a cheer. Those in the forefront began to run. “I know.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“<span class="txit">Do</span> you?” Eddie asked. His eyes were almost pleading. “Do you really? Because . . . man, it’s so <span class="txit">crazy</span>—”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake looked at the heaped Wolves. The green hoods. The gray leggings. The black boots. The snarling, decomposing faces. Eddie had already pulled one of those rotting metal faces away and looked at what was beneath it. Nothing but smooth metal, plus lenses that served as eyes, a round mesh grille that doubtless served as a nose, two sprouted microphones at the temples for ears. No, all the personality these things had was in the masks and clothing they wore.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Crazy or not, I know what they are, Eddie. Or where they come from, at least. Marvel Comics.”</p>

  <p class="indent">A look of sublime relief filled Eddie’s face. He bent and kissed Jake on the cheek. A ghost of a smile touched the boy’s mouth. It wasn’t much, but it was a start.</p>

  <p class="indent">“The <span class="txit">Spider-Man</span> books,” Eddie said. “When I was a kid I couldn’t get enough of those things.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I didn’t buy em myself,” Jake said, “but Timmy Mucci down at Mid-Town Lanes used to have a terrible jones for the Marvel mags. <span class="txit">Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America,</span> all of em. These guys . . . ”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_906"></a>“They look like Dr. Doom,” Eddie said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yeah,” Jake said. “It’s not exact, I’m sure the masks were modified to make them look a little more like wolves, but otherwise . . . same green hoods, same green cloaks. Yeah, Dr. Doom.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“And the sneetches,” Eddie said. “Have you ever heard of Harry Potter?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I don’t think so. Have you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No, and I’ll tell you why. Because the sneetches are from the future. Maybe from some Marvel comic book that’ll come out in 1990 or 1995. Do you see what I’m saying?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake nodded.</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s all nineteen, isn’t it?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yeah,” Jake said. “Nineteen, ninety-nine, and nineteen-ninety-nine.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Eddie glanced around. “Where’s Suze?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Probably went after her chair,” Jake said. But before either of them could explore the question of Susannah Dean’s whereabouts any further (and by then it was probably too late, anyway), the first of the <span class="txit">folken</span> from town arrived. Eddie and Jake were swept into a wild, impromptu celebration—hugged, kissed, shaken by the hand, laughed over, wept over, thanked and thanked and thanked.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TWENTY-ONE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Ten minutes after the main body of the townsfolk arrived, Rosalita reluctantly approached Roland. The gunslinger was extremely glad to see her. Eben Took had taken him by the arms and was telling him—over and over again, endlessly, it seemed—<a id="page_907"></a>how wrong he and Telford had been, how utterly and completely wrong, and how when Roland and his ka-tet were ready to move on, Eben Took would outfit them from stem to stern and not a penny would they pay.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Roland!” Rosa said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland excused himself and took her by the arm, leading her a little way up the road. The Wolves had been scattered everywhere and were now being mercilessly looted of their possessions by the laughing, deliriously happy <span class="txit">folken</span>. Stragglers were arriving every minute.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Rosa, what is it?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s your lady,” Rosa said. “Susannah.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“What of her?” Roland asked. Frowning, he looked around. He didn’t see Susannah, couldn’t remember when he <span class="txit">had</span> last seen her. When he’d given Jake the cigarette? That long ago? He thought so. “Where is she?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“That’s just it,” Rosa said. “I don’t know. So I peeked into the waggon she came in, thinking that perhaps she’d gone in there to rest. That perhaps she felt faint or gut-sick, do ya. But she’s not there. And Roland . . . her chair is gone.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Gods!” Roland snarled, and slammed his fist against his leg. “Oh, <span class="txit">gods</span>!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Rosalita took a step back from him, alarmed.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Where’s Eddie?” Roland asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">She pointed. Eddie was so deep in a cluster of admiring men and women that Roland didn’t think he would have seen him, but for the child riding on his shoulders; it was Heddon Jaffords, an enormous grin on his face.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Are you sure you want to disturb him?” Rosa <a id="page_908"></a>asked timidly. “May be she’s just gone off a bit, to pull herself back together.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Gone off a bit,</span> Roland thought. He could feel a blackness filling his heart. His sinking heart. She’d gone off a bit, all right. And he knew who had stepped in to take her place. Their attention had wandered in the aftermath of the fight . . . Jake’s grief . . . the congratulations of the <span class="txit">folken</span> . . . the confusion and the joy and the singing . . . but that was no excuse.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Gunslingers!”</span> he roared, and the jubilant crowd quieted at once. Had he cared to look, he could have seen the fear that lay just beneath their relief and adulation. It would not have been new to him; they were always afraid of those who came wearing the hard calibers. What they wanted of such when the shooting was done was to give them a final meal, perhaps a final gratitude-fuck, then send them on their way and pick up their own peaceful farming-tools once more.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Well,</span> Roland thought, <span class="txit">we’ll be going soon enough. In fact, one of us has gone already. Gods!</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Gunslingers, to me! To me!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Eddie reached Roland first. He looked around. “Where’s Susannah?” he asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland pointed into the stony wasteland of bluffs and arroyos, then elevated his finger until it was pointing at a black hole just below the skyline. “I think there,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">All the color had drained out of Eddie Dean’s face. “That’s Doorway Cave you’re pointing at,” he said. “Isn’t it?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland nodded.</p>

  <p class="indent">“But the ball . . . Black Thirteen . . . she wouldn’t <a id="page_909"></a>even go <span class="txit">near</span> it when it was in Callahan’s church—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No,” Roland said. “<span class="txit">Susannah</span> wouldn’t. But she’s not in charge anymore.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Mia?” Jake asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes.” Roland studied the high hole with his faded eyes. “Mia’s gone to have her baby. She’s gone to have her chap.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No,” Eddie said. His hands wandered out and took hold of Roland’s shirt. Around them, the <span class="txit">folken</span> stood silently, watching. “Roland, say no.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“We’ll go after her and hope we’re not too late,” Roland said.</p>

  <p class="indent">But in his heart, he knew they already were.<a id="page_910"></a></p>
