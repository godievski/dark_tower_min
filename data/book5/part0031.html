  <p class="noindent">Jake and Benny Slightman spent the morning of that same day moving hay bales from the upper lofts of the Rocking B’s three inner barns to the lower lofts, then breaking them open. The afternoon was for swimming and water-fighting in the Whye, which was still pleasant enough if one avoided the deep pools; those had grown cold with the season.</p>

  <p class="indent">In between these two activities they ate a huge lunch in the bunkhouse with half a dozen of the hands (not Slightman the Elder; he was off at Telford’s Buckhead Ranch, working a stock-trade). “I en’t seen that boy of Ben’s work s’hard in my life,” Cookie said as he put fried chops down on the table and the boys dug in eagerly. “You’ll wear him plumb out, Jake.”</p>

  <p class="indent">That was Jake’s intention, of course. After haying in the morning, swimming in the afternoon, and a dozen or more barn-jumps for each of them by the red light of evening, he thought Benny would sleep like the dead. The problem was he might do the same himself. When he went out to wash at the pump—sunset come and gone by then, leaving ashes of roses deepening to true dark—he took Oy with him. He splashed his face clean and <a id="page_720"></a>flicked drops of water for the animal to catch, which he did with great alacrity. Then Jake dropped to one knee and gently took hold of the sides of the billy-bumbler’s face. “Listen to me, Oy.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oy!”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I’m going to go to sleep, but when the moon rises, I want you to wake me up. Quietly, do’ee ken?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Ken!” Which might mean something or nothing. If someone had been taking wagers on it, Jake would have bet on something. He had great faith in Oy. Or maybe it was love. Or maybe those things were the same.</p>

  <p class="indent">“When the moon rises. Say moon, Oy.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Moon!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Sounded good, but Jake would set his own internal alarm clock to wake him up at moonrise. Because he wanted to go out to where he’d seen Benny’s Da’ and Andy that other time. That queer meeting worried at his mind more rather than less as time went by. He didn’t want to believe Benny’s Da’ was involved with the Wolves—Andy, either—but he had to make sure. Because it was what Roland would do. For that reason if no other.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TWO</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">The two boys lay in Benny’s room. There was one bed, which Benny had of course offered to his guest, but Jake had refused it. What they’d come up with instead was a system by which Benny took the bed on what he called “even-hand” nights, and Jake took it on “odd-hand” nights. This was Jake’s night for the floor, and he was glad. Benny’s goosedown-filled <a id="page_721"></a>mattress was far too soft. In light of his plan to rise with the moon, the floor was probably better. Safer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Benny lay with his hands behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. He had coaxed Oy up onto the bed with him and the bumbler lay sleeping in a curled comma, his nose beneath his cartoon squiggle of a tail.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Jake?” A whisper. “You asleep?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Me neither.” A pause. “It’s been great, having you here.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s been great for me,” Jake said, and meant it.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Sometimes being the only kid gets lonely.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Don’t I know it . . . and I was <span class="txit">always</span> the only one.” Jake paused. “Bet you were sad after your sissa died.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Sometimes I’m still sad.” At least he said it in a matter-of-fact tone, which made it easier to hear. “Reckon you’ll stay after you beat the Wolves?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Probably not long.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You’re on a quest, aren’t you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I guess so.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“For what?”</p>

  <p class="indent">The quest was to save the Dark Tower in this where and the rose in the New York where he and Eddie and Susannah had come from, but Jake did not want to say this to Benny, much as he liked him. The Tower and the rose were kind of secret things. The ka-tet’s business. But neither did he want to lie.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Roland doesn’t talk about stuff much,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">A longer pause. The sound of Benny shifting, doing it quietly so as not to disturb Oy. “He scares me a little, your dinh.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_722"></a>Jake thought about that, then said: “He scares me a little, too.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“He scares my Pa.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake was suddenly very alert. “Really?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes. He says it wouldn’t surprise him if, after you got rid of the Wolves, you turned on us. Then he said he was just joking, but that the old cowboy with the hard face scared him. I reckon that must have been your dinh, don’t you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yeah,” Jake said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake had begun thinking Benny had gone to sleep when the other boy asked, “What was your room like back where you came from?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake thought of his room and at first found it surprisingly hard to picture. It had been a long time since he’d thought of it. And now that he did, he was embarrassed to describe it too closely to Benny. His friend lived well indeed by Calla standards—Jake guessed there were very few smallhold kids Benny’s age with their own rooms—but he would think a room such as Jake could describe that of an enchanted prince. The television? The stereo, with all his records, and the headphones for privacy? His posters of Stevie Wonder and The Jackson Five? His microscope, which showed him things too small to see with the naked eye? Was he supposed to tell this boy about such wonders and miracles?</p>

  <p class="indent">“It was like this, only I had a desk,” Jake said at last.</p>

  <p class="indent">“A <span class="txit">writing</span> desk?” Benny got up on one elbow.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Well <span class="txit">yeah,</span>” Jake said, the tone implying <span class="txit">Sheesh, what else?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">“Paper? Pens? Quill pens?”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_723"></a>“Paper,” Jake agreed. Here, at least, was a wonder Benny could understand. “And pens. But not quill. Ball.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Ball pens? I don’t understand.”</p>

  <p class="indent">So Jake began to explain, but halfway through he heard a snore. He looked across the room and saw Benny still facing him, but now with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p class="indent">Oy opened <span class="txit">his</span> eyes—they were bright in the darkness—then winked at Jake. After that, he appeared to go back to sleep.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake looked at Benny for a long time, deeply troubled in ways he did not precisely understand . . . or want to.</p>

  <p class="indent">At last, he went to sleep himself.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">THREE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Some dark, dreamless time later, he came back to a semblance of wakefulness because of pressure on his wrist. Something pulling there. Almost painful. Teeth. Oy’s.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oy, no, quittit,” he mumbled, but Oy would not stop. He had Jake’s wrist in his jaws and continued to shake it gently from side to side, stopping occasionally to administer a brisk tug. He only quit when Jake finally sat up and stared dopily out into the silver-flooded night.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Moon,” Oy said. He was sitting on the floor beside Jake, jaws open in an unmistakable grin, eyes bright. They <span class="txit">should</span> have been bright; a tiny white stone burned deep down in each one. <span class="txit">“Moon!”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">“Yeah,” Jake whispered, and then closed his fingers <a id="page_724"></a>around Oy’s muzzle. “Hush!” He let go and looked over at Benny, who was now facing the wall and snoring deeply. Jake doubted if a howitzer shell would wake him.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Moon,” Oy said, much more quietly. Now he was looking out the window. “Moon, moon. Moon.”</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">FOUR</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Jake would have ridden bareback, but he needed Oy with him, and that made bareback difficult, maybe impossible. Luckily, the little border-pony sai Overholser had loaned him was as tame as a tabby-cat, and there was a scuffy old practice saddle in the barn’s tackroom that even a kid could handle with ease.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake saddled the horse, then tied his bedroll behind, to the part Calla cowboys called the boat. He could feel the weight of the Ruger inside the roll—and, if he squeezed, the shape of it, as well. The duster with the commodious pocket in the front was hanging on a nail in the tackroom. Jake took it, whipped it into something like a fat belt, and cinched it around his middle. Kids in his school had sometimes worn their outer shirts that way on warm days. Like those of his room, this memory seemed far away, part of a circus parade that had marched through town . . . and then left.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">That life was richer,</span> a voice deep in his mind whispered.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">This one is truer,</span> whispered another, even deeper.</p>

  <p class="indent">He believed that second voice, but his heart was still heavy with sadness and worry as he led the border-pony out through the back of the barn and <a id="page_725"></a>away from the house. Oy padded along at his heel, occasionally looking up at the sky and muttering “Moon, moon,” but mostly sniffing the crisscrossing scents on the ground. This trip was dangerous. Just crossing Devar-Tete Whye—going from the Calla side of things to the Thunderclap side—was dangerous, and Jake knew it. Yet what really troubled him was the sense of looming heartache. He thought of Benny, saying it had been great to have Jake at the Rocking B to chum around with. He wondered if Benny would feel the same way a week from now.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Doesn’t matter,” he sighed. “It’s ka.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Ka,” Oy said, then looked up. “Moon. Ka, moon. Moon, ka.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Shut up,” Jake said, not unkindly.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Shut up ka,” Oy said amiably. “Shut up moon. Shut up Ake. Shut up Oy.” It was the most he’d said in months, and once it was out he fell silent. Jake walked his horse another ten minutes, past the bunkhouse and its mixed music of snores, grunts, and farts, then over the next hill. At that point, with the East Road in sight, he judged it safe to ride. He unrolled the duster, put it on, then deposited Oy in the pouch and mounted up.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">FIVE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">He was pretty sure he could go right to the place where Andy and Slightman had crossed the river, but reckoned he’d only have one good shot at this, and Roland would’ve said pretty sure wasn’t good enough in such a case. So he went back to the place where he and Benny had tented instead, and <a id="page_726"></a>from there to the jut of granite which had reminded him of a partially buried ship. Once again Oy stood panting into his ear. Jake had no problem sighting on the round rock with the shiny surface. The dead log that had washed up against it was still there, too, because the river hadn’t done anything but fall over the last weeks. There had been no rain whatever, and this was something Jake was counting on to help him.</p>

  <p class="indent">He scrambled back up to the flat place where he and Benny had tented out. Here he’d left his pony tethered to a bush. He led it down to the river, then scooped up Oy and rode across. The pony wasn’t big, but the water still didn’t come up much higher than his fetlocks. In less than a minute, they were on the far bank.</p>

  <p class="indent">It looked the same on this side, but wasn’t. Jake knew it right away. Moonlight or no moonlight, it was darker somehow. Not exactly the way todash–New York had been dark, and there were no chimes, but there was a similarity, just the same. A sense of something waiting, and eyes that could turn in his direction if he was foolish enough to alert their owners to his presence. He had come to the edge of End-World. Jake’s flesh broke out in goosebumps and he shivered. Oy looked up at him.</p>

  <p class="indent">“S’all right,” Jake whispered. “Just had to get it out of my system.”</p>

  <p class="indent">He dismounted, put Oy down, and stowed the duster in the shadow of the round rock. He didn’t think he’d need a coat for this part of his excursion; he was sweating, nervous. The babble of the river was loud, and he kept shooting glances across to the other side, wanting to make sure no one was <a id="page_727"></a>coming. He didn’t want to be surprised. That sense of presence, of <span class="txit">others,</span> was both strong and unpleasant. There was nothing good about what lived on this side of the Devar-Tete Whye; of that much Jake was sure. He felt better when he’d taken the docker’s clutch out of the bedroll, cinched it in place, and then added the Ruger. The Ruger made him into a different person, one he didn’t always like. But here, on the far side of the Whye, he was delighted to feel gunweight against his ribs, and delighted to be that person; that <span class="txit">gunslinger</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Something farther off to the east screamed like a woman in life-ending agony. Jake knew it was only a rock-cat—he’d heard them before, when he’d been at the river with Benny, either fishing or swimming—but he still put his hand on the butt of the Ruger until it stopped. Oy had assumed the bowing position, front paws apart, head lowered, rump pointed skyward. Usually this meant he wanted to play, but there was nothing playful about his bared teeth.</p>

  <p class="indent">“S’okay,” Jake said. He rummaged in his bedroll again (he hadn’t bothered to bring a saddlebag) until he found a red-checked cloth. This was Slightman the Elder’s neckerchief, stolen four days previous from beneath the bunkhouse table, where the foreman had dropped it during a game of Watch Me and then forgotten it.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Quite the little thief I am,</span> Jake thought. <span class="txit">My Dad’s gun, now Benny’s Dad’s snotrag. I can’t tell if I’m working my way up or down.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">It was Roland’s voice that replied. <span class="txit">You’re doing what you were called here to do. Why don’t you stop beating your breast and get started?</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_728"></a>Jake held the neckerchief between his hands and looked down at Oy. “This always works in the movies,” he said to the bumbler. “I have no idea if it works in real life . . . especially after weeks have gone by.” He lowered the neckerchief to Oy, who stretched out his long neck and sniffed it delicately. “Find this smell, Oy. Find it and follow it.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oy!” But he just sat there, looking up at Jake.</p>

  <p class="indent">“This, Dumbo,” Jake said, letting him smell it again. “Find it! Go on!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Oy got up, turned around twice, then began to saunter north along the bank of the river. He lowered his nose occasionally to the rocky ground, but seemed a lot more interested in the occasional dying-woman howl of the rock-cat. Jake watched his friend with steadily diminishing hope. Well, he’d seen which way Slightman had gone. He could go in that direction himself, course around a little, see what there was to see.</p>

  <p class="indent">Oy turned around, came back toward Jake, then stopped. He sniffed a patch of ground more closely. The place where Slightman had come out of the water? It could have been. Oy made a thoughtful <span class="txit">hoof</span>ing sound far back in his throat and then turned to his right—east. He slipped sinuously between two rocks. Jake, now feeling at least a tickle of hope, mounted up and followed.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">SIX</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">They hadn’t gone far before Jake realized Oy was following an actual path that wound through the hilly, rocky, arid land on this side of the river. He began to see signs of technology: a cast-off, rusty <a id="page_729"></a>electrical coil, something that looked like an ancient circuit-board poking out of the sand, tiny shards and shatters of glass. In the black moonlight-created shadow of a large boulder, he spied what looked like a whole bottle. He dismounted, picked it up, poured out God knew how many decades (or centuries) of accumulated sand, and looked at it. Written on the side in raised letters was a word he recognized: Nozz-A-La.</p>

  <p class="indent">“The drink of finer bumhugs everywhere,” Jake murmured, and put the bottle down again. Beside it was a crumpled-up cigarette pack. He smoothed it out, revealing a picture of a red-lipped woman wearing a jaunty red hat. She was holding a cigarette between two glamorously long fingers. <span class="smallcaps">PARTI</span> appeared to be the brand name.</p>

  <p class="indent">Oy, meanwhile, was standing ten or twelve yards farther along and looking back at him over one low shoulder.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Okay,” Jake said. “I’m coming.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Other paths joined the one they were on, and Jake realized this was a continuation of the East Road. He could see only a few scattered bootprints and smaller, deeper footprints. These were in places guarded by high rocks—wayside coves the prevailing winds didn’t often reach. He guessed the bootprints were Slightman’s, the deep footprints Andy’s. There were no others. But there <span class="txit">would</span> be, and not many days from now, either. The prints of the Wolves’ gray horses, coming out of the east. They would also be deep prints, Jake reckoned. Deep like Andy’s.</p>

  <p class="indent">Up ahead, the path breasted the top of a hill. On either side were fantastically misshapen organ-pipe <a id="page_730"></a>cactuses with great thick barrel arms that seemed to point every which way. Oy was standing there, looking down at something, and once more seeming to grin. As Jake approached him, he could smell the cactus-plants. The odor was bitter and tangy. It reminded him of his father’s martinis.</p>

  <p class="indent">He sat astride his pony beside Oy, looking down. At the bottom of the hill on the right was a shattered concrete driveway. A sliding gate had been frozen half-open ages ago, probably long before the Wolves started raiding the borderland Callas for children. Beyond it was a building with a curved metal roof. Small windows lined the side Jake could see, and his heart lifted at the sight of the steady white glow that came through them. Not ’seners, and not lightbulbs, either (what Roland called “sparklights”). Only fluorescents threw that kind of white light. In his New York life, fluorescent lights made him think mostly of unhappy, boring things: giant stores where everything was always on sale and you could never find what you wanted, sleepy afternoons at school when the teacher droned on and on about the trade routes of ancient China or the mineral deposits of Peru and rain poured endlessly down outside and it seemed the Closing Bell would never ring, doctors’ offices where you always wound up sitting on a tissue-covered exam table in your underpants, cold and embarrassed and somehow positive that you would be getting a shot.</p>

  <p class="indent">Tonight, though, those lights cheered him up.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Good boy!” he told the bumbler.</p>

  <p class="indent">Instead of responding as he usually did, by repeating his name, Oy looked past Jake and commenced a low growl. At the same moment the pony <a id="page_731"></a>shifted and gave a nervous whinny. Jake reined him, realizing that bitter (but not entirely unpleasant) smell of gin and juniper had gotten stronger. He looked around and saw two spiny barrels of the cactus-tangle on his right swiveling slowly and blindly toward him. There was a faint grinding sound, and dribbles of white sap were running down the cactus’s central barrel. The needles on the arms swinging toward Jake looked long and wicked in the moonlight. The thing had smelled him, and it was hungry.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Come on,” he told Oy, and booted the pony’s sides lightly. The pony needed no further urging. It hurried downhill, not quite trotting, toward the building with the fluorescent lights. Oy gave the moving cactus a final mistrustful look, then followed them.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">SEVEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Jake reached the driveway and stopped. About fifty yards farther down the road (it was now very definitely a road, or had been once upon a time), train-tracks crossed and then ran on toward the Devar-Tete Whye, where a low bridge took them across. The <span class="txit">folken</span> called that bridge “the causeway.” The older <span class="txit">folken,</span> Callahan had told them, called it the <span class="txit">devil’s</span> causeway.</p>

  <p class="indent">“The trains that bring the roont ones back from Thunderclap come on those tracks,” he murmured to Oy. And did he feel the tug of the Beam? Jake was sure he did. He had an idea that when they left Calla Bryn Sturgis—<span class="txit">if</span> they left Calla Bryn Sturgis—it would be along those tracks.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_732"></a>He stood where he was a moment longer, feet out of the stirrups, then headed the pony up the crumbling driveway toward the building. To Jake it looked like a Quonset hut on a military base. Oy, with his short legs, was having hard going on the broken-up surface. That busted-up paving would be dangerous for his horse, too. Once the frozen gate was behind them, he dismounted and looked for a place to tether his mount. There were bushes close by, but something told him they were <span class="txit">too</span> close. Too visible. He led the pony out onto the hardpan, stopped, and looked around at Oy. “Stay!”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Stay! Oy! Ake!”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake found more bushes behind a pile of boulders like a strew of huge and eroded toy blocks. Here he felt satisified enough to tether the pony. Once it was done, he stroked the long, velvety muzzle. “Not long,” he said. “Can you be good?”</p>

  <p class="indent">The pony blew through his nose and appeared to nod. Which meant exactly nothing, Jake knew. And it was probably a needless precaution, anyway. Still, better safe than sorry. He went back to the driveway and bent to scoop the bumbler up. As soon as he straightened, a row of brilliant lights flashed on, pinning him like a bug on a microscope stage. Holding Oy in the curve of one arm, Jake raised the other to shield his eyes. Oy whined and blinked.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was no warning shout, no stern request for identification, only the faint snuffle of the breeze. The lights were turned on by motion-sensors, Jake guessed. What came next? Machine-gun fire directed by dipolar computers? A scurry <a id="page_733"></a>of small but deadly robots like those Roland, Eddie, and Susannah had dispatched in the clearing where the Beam they were following had begun? Maybe a big net dropping from overhead, like in this jungle movie he’d seen once on TV?</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake looked up. There was no net. No machine-guns, either. He started walking forward again, picking his way around the deepest of the potholes and jumping over a washout. Beyond this latter, the driveway was tilted and cracked but mostly whole. “You can get down now,” he told Oy. “Boy, you’re heavy. Watch out or I’ll have to stick you in Weight Watchers.”</p>

  <p class="indent">He looked straight ahead, squinting and shielding his eyes from the fierce glare. The lights were in a row running just beneath the Quonset’s curved roof. They threw his shadow out behind him, long and black. He saw rock-cat corpses, two on his left and two more on his right. Three of them were little more than skeletons. The fourth was in a high state of decomposition, but Jake could see a hole that looked too big for a bullet. He thought it had been made by a bah-bolt. The idea was comforting. No weapons of super-science at work here. Still, he was crazy not to be hightailing it back toward the river and the Calla beyond it. Wasn’t he?</p>

  <p class="indent">“Crazy,” he said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Razy,” Oy said, once more padding along at Jake’s heel.</p>

  <p class="indentb">A minute later they reached the door of the hut. Above it, on a rusting steel plate, was this:</p>

  <div class="sidebar">
    <p class="centerb"><a id="page_734"></a><span class="txbf1">NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS, LTD.</span></p>

    <p class="centerb"><span class="txbf1">Northeast Corridor</span></p>

    <p class="centerb"><span class="txbf1">Arc Quadrant</span></p>

    <p class="centerb1"><span class="txbf1">OUTPOST 16</span></p>

    <p class="centerb1"><span class="txbf1">Medium Security</span></p>

    <p class="centerb"><span class="txbf1">VERBAL ENTRY CODE REQUIRED</span></p>
  </div>

  <p class="indentb">On the door itself, now hanging crooked by only two screws, was another sign. A joke? Some sort of nickname? Jake thought it might be a little of both. The letters were choked with rust and eroded by God knew how many years of blowing sand and grit, but he could still read them:</p>

  <div class="sidebar">
    <p class="centerb"><span class="txbf1">WELCOME TO THE DOGAN</span></p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">EIGHT</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Jake expected the door to be locked and wasn’t disappointed. The lever handle moved up and down only the tiniest bit. He guessed that when it had been new, there’d been no give in it at all. To the left of the door was a rusty steel panel with a button and a speaker grille. Beneath it was the word <span class="font3">VERBAL</span>. Jake reached for the button, and suddenly the lights lining the top of the building went out, leaving him in what at first seemed like utter darkness. <span class="txit">They’re on a timer,</span> he thought, waiting for his eyes to adjust. <span class="txit">A pretty short one. Or maybe they’re just getting tired, like everything else the Old People left behind.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">His eyes readapted to the moonlight and he could see the entry-box again. He had a pretty <a id="page_735"></a>good idea of what the verbal entry code must be. He pushed the button.</p>

  <p class="indent">“WELCOME TO ARC QUADRANT OUTPOST 16,” said a voice. Jake jumped back, stifling a cry. He had expected a voice, but not one so eerily like that of Blaine the Mono. He almost expected it to drop into a John Wayne drawl and call him little trailhand. “THIS IS A MEDIUM SECURITY OUTPOST. PLEASE GIVE THE VERBAL ENTRY CODE. YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS. NINE . . . EIGHT . . . ”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Nineteen,” Jake said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“INCORRECT ENTRY CODE. YOU MAY RETRY ONCE. FIVE . . . FOUR . . . THREE . . . ”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Ninety-nine,” Jake said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“THANK YOU.”</p>

  <p class="indent">The door clicked open.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">NINE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Jake and Oy walked into a room that reminded him of the vast control-area Roland had carried him through beneath the city of Lud, as they had followed the steel ball which had guided them to Blaine’s cradle. This room was smaller, of course, but many of the dials and panels looked the same. There were chairs at some of the consoles, the kind that would roll along the floor so that the people who worked here could move from place to place without getting to their feet. There was a steady sigh of fresh air, but Jake could hear occasional rough rattling sounds from the machinery driving it. And while three-quarters of the panels were lighted, he could see a good many that were dark. Old and <a id="page_736"></a>tired: he had been right about that. In one corner was a grinning skeleton in the remains of a brown khaki uniform.</p>

  <p class="indent">On one side of the room was a bank of TV monitors. They reminded Jake a little bit of his father’s study at home, although his father had had only three screens—one for each network—and here there were . . . he counted. Thirty. Three of them were fuzzy, showing pictures he couldn’t really make out. Two were rolling rapidly up and up, as if the vertical hold had fritzed out. Four were entirely dark. The other twenty-one were projecting pictures, and Jake looked at these with growing wonder. Half a dozen showed various expanses of desert, including the hilltop guarded by the two misshapen cactuses. Two more showed the outpost—the Dogan—from behind and from the driveway side. Under these were three screens showing the Dogan’s interior. One showed a room that looked like a galley or kitchen. The second showed a small bunkhouse that looked equipped to sleep eight (in one of the bunks, an upper, Jake spied another skeleton). The third inside-the-Dogan screen presented this room, from a high angle. Jake could see himself and Oy. There was a screen with a stretch of the railroad tracks on it, and one showing the Little Whye from this side, moonstruck and beautiful. On the far right was the causeway with the train-tracks crossing it.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was the images on the other eight operating screens that astounded Jake. One showed Took’s General Store, now dark and deserted, closed up till daylight. One showed the Pavilion. Two showed the Calla high street. Another showed Our Lady of <a id="page_737"></a>Serenity Church, and one showed the living room of the rectory . . . <span class="txit">inside</span> the rectory! Jake could actually see the Pere’s cat, Snugglebutt, lying asleep on the hearth. The other two showed angles of what Jake assumed was the Manni village (he had not been there).</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Where in hell’s name are the</span> cameras? Jake wondered. <span class="txit">How come nobody sees them?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Because they were too small, he supposed. And because they’d been hidden. <span class="txit">Smile, you’re on Candid Camera</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">But the church . . . the rectory . . . those were buildings that hadn’t even <span class="txit">existed</span> in the Calla until a few years previous. And <span class="txit">inside</span>? <span class="txit">Inside</span> the rectory? Who had put a camera there, and when?</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake didn’t know when, but he had a terrible idea that he knew who. Thank God they’d done most of their palavering on the porch, or outside on the lawn. But still, how much must the Wolves—or their masters—know? How much had the infernal machines of this place, the infernal <span class="txit">fucking</span> machines of this place, recorded?</p>

  <p class="indent">And transmitted?</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake felt pain in his hands and realized they were tightly clenched, the nails biting into his palms. He opened them with an effort. He kept expecting the voice from the speaker-grille—the voice so much like Blaine’s—to challenge him, ask him what he was doing here. But it was mostly silent in this room of not-quite-ruin; no sounds but the low hum of the equipment and the occasionally raspy whoosh of the air-exchangers. He looked over his shoulder at the door and saw it had closed behind him on a pneumatic hinge. He wasn’t worried <a id="page_738"></a>about that; from this side it would probably open easily. If it didn’t, good old ninety-nine would get him out again. He remembered introducing himself to the <span class="txit">folken</span> that first night in the Pavilion, a night that already seemed a long time ago. <span class="txit">I am Jake Chambers, son of Elmer, the Line of Eld,</span> he had told them. <span class="txit">The ka-tet of the Ninety and Nine</span>. Why had he said that? He didn’t know. All he knew was that things kept showing up again. In school, Ms. Avery had read them a poem called “The Second Coming,” by William Butler Yeats. There had been something in it about a hawk turning and turning in a widening gyre, which was—according to Ms. Avery—a kind of circle. But here things were in a spiral, not a circle. For the Ka-Tet of Nineteen (or of the Ninety and Nine; Jake had an idea they were really the same), things were tightening up even as the world around them grew old, grew loose, shut down, shed pieces of itself. It was like being in the cyclone which had carried Dorothy off to the Land of Oz, where witches were real and bumhugs ruled. To Jake’s heart it made perfect sense that they should be seeing the same things over and over, and more and more often, because—</p>

  <p class="indent">Movement on one of the screens caught his eye. He looked at it and saw Benny’s Da’ and Andy the Messenger Robot coming over the hilltop guarded by the cactus sentries. As he watched, the spiny barrel arms swung inward to block the road—and, perhaps, impale the prey. Andy, however, had no reason to fear cactus spines. He swung an arm and broke one of the barrels off halfway down its length. It fell into the dust, spurting white goo. Maybe it wasn’t sap at all, Jake thought. Maybe it <a id="page_739"></a>was blood. In any case, the cactus on the other side swiveled away in a hurry. Andy and Ben Slightman stopped for a moment, perhaps to discuss this. The screen’s resolution wasn’t clear enough to show if the human’s mouth was moving or not.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake was seized by an awful, throat-closing panic. His body suddenly seemed too heavy, as if it were being tugged by the gravity of a giant planet like Jupiter or Saturn. He couldn’t breathe; his chest lay perfectly flat. <span class="txit">This is what Goldilocks would have felt like,</span> he thought in a faint and distant way, <span class="txit">if she had awakened in the little bed that was just right to hear the Three Bears coming back in downstairs</span>. He hadn’t eaten the porridge, he hadn’t broken Baby Bear’s chair, but he now knew too many secrets. They boiled down to <span class="txit">one</span> secret. One monstrous secret.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now they were coming down the road. Coming to the Dogan.</p>

  <p class="indent">Oy was looking up at him anxiously, his long neck stretched to the max, but Jake could barely see him. Black flowers were blooming in front of his eyes. Soon he would faint. They would find him stretched out here on the floor. Oy might try to protect him, but if Andy didn’t take care of the bumbler, Ben Slightman would. There were four dead rock-cats out there and Benny’s Da’ had dispatched at least one of them with his trusty bah. One small barking billy-bumbler would be no problem for him.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Would you be so cowardly, then?</span> Roland asked inside his head. <span class="txit">But why would they kill such a coward as you? Why would they not just send you west with the broken ones who have forgotten the faces of their fathers?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">That brought him back. Most of the way, at least. <a id="page_740"></a>He took a huge breath, yanking in air until the bottoms of his lungs hurt. He let it out in an explosive whoosh. Then he slapped himself across the face, good and hard.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Ake!”</span> Oy cried in a reproving—almost shocked—voice.</p>

  <p class="indent">“S’okay,” Jake said. He looked at the monitors showing the galley and the bunkroom and decided on the latter. There was nothing to hide behind or under in the galley. There might be a closet, but what if there wasn’t? He’d be screwed.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Oy, to me,” he said, and crossed the humming room beneath the bright white lights.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">The bunkroom held the ghostly aroma of ancient spices: cinnamon and clove. Jake wondered—in a distracted, back-of-the-mind way—if the tombs beneath the Pyramids had smelled this way when the first explorers had broken into them. From the upper bunk in the corner, the reclining skeleton grinned at him, as if in welcome. <span class="txit">Feel like a nap, little trailhand? I’m taking a long one!</span> Its ribcage shimmered with silky overlays of spiderweb, and Jake wondered in that same distracted way how many generations of spider-babies had been born in that empty cavity. On another pillow lay a jawbone, prodding a ghostly, ghastly memory from the back of the boy’s mind. Once, in a world where he had died, the gunslinger had found a bone like that. And used it.</p>

  <p class="indent">The forefront of his mind pounded with two cold questions and one even colder resolve. The <a id="page_741"></a>questions were how long it would take them to get here and whether or not they would discover his pony. If Slightman had been riding a horse of his own, Jake was sure the amiable little pony would have whinnied a greeting already. Luckily, Slightman was on foot, as he had been last time. Jake would have come on foot himself, had he known his goal was less than a mile east of the river. Of course, when he’d snuck away from the Rocking B, he hadn’t even been sure that he <span class="txit">had</span> a goal.</p>

  <p class="indent">The resolve was to kill both the tin-man and the flesh-and-blood man if he was discovered. If he could, that was. Andy might be tough, but those bulging blue-glass eyes looked like a weak point. If he could blind him—</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">There’ll be water if God wills it,</span> said the gunslinger who now always lived in his head, for good and ill. <span class="txit">Your job now is to hide if you can. Where?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Not in the bunks. All of them were visible in the monitor covering this room and there was no way he could impersonate a skeleton. Under one of the two bunk-stacks at the rear? Risky, but it would serve . . . unless . . .</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake spied another door. He sprang forward, depressed the lever-handle, and pulled the door open. It was a closet, and closets made fine hiding places, but this one was filled with jumbles of dusty electronic equipment, top to bottom. Some of it fell out.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Beans!” he whispered in a low, urgent voice. He picked up what had fallen, tossed it high and low, then shut the closet door again. Okay, it would have to be under one of the beds—</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_742"></a>“WELCOME TO ARC QUADRANT OUTPOST 16,” boomed the recorded voice. Jake flinched, and saw another door, this one to his left and standing partway open. Try the door or squeeze under one of the two tiers of bunks at the rear of the room? He had time to try one bolthole or the other, but not both. “THIS IS A MEDIUM SECURITY OUTPOST.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake went for the door, and it was just as well he went when he did, because Slightman didn’t let the recording finish its spiel. “Ninety-nine,” came his voice from the loudspeakers, and the recording thanked him.</p>

  <p class="indent">It was another closet, this one empty except for two or three moldering shirts in one corner and a dust-caked poncho slumped on a hook. The air was almost as dusty as the poncho, and Oy uttered three fast, delicate sneezes as he padded in.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake dropped to one knee and put an arm around Oy’s slender neck. “No more of that unless you want to get us both killed,” he said. “You be quiet, Oy.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Kiyit Oy,” the bumbler whispered back, and winked. Jake reached up and pulled the door back to within two inches of shut, as it had been before. He hoped.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">ELEVEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">He could hear them quite clearly—<span class="txit">too</span> clearly. Jake realized there were mikes and speakers all over this place. The idea did nothing for his peace of mind. Because if he and Oy could hear <span class="txit">them</span> . . .</p>

  <p class="indent">It was the cactuses they were talking about, or <a id="page_743"></a>rather that Slightman was talking about. He called them boom-flurry, and wanted to know what had gotten them all fashed.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Almost certainly more rock-cats, sai,” Andy said in his complacent, slightly prissy voice. Eddie said Andy reminded him of a robot named C3PO in <span class="txit">Star Wars,</span> a movie to which Jake had been looking forward. He had missed it by less than a month. “It’s their mating season, you know.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Piss on that,” Slightman said. “Are you telling me boom-flurry don’t know rock-cats from something they can actually catch and eat? Someone’s been out here, I tell you. And not long since.”</p>

  <p class="indent">A cold thought slipped into Jake’s mind: had the floor of the Dogan been dusty? He’d been too busy gawking at the control panels and TV monitors to notice. If he and Oy had left tracks, those two might have noticed already. They might only be pretending to have a conversation about the cactuses while they actually crept toward the bunkroom door.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake took the Ruger out of the docker’s clutch and held it in his right hand with his thumb on the safety.</p>

  <p class="indent">“A guilty conscience doth make cowards of us all,” Andy said in his complacent, just-thought-you’d-like-to-know voice. “That’s my free adaptation of a—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Shut up, you bag of bolts and wires,” Slightman snarled. “I—” Then he screamed. Jake felt Oy stiffen against him, felt his fur begin to rise. The bumbler started to growl. Jake slipped a hand around his snout.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Let go!” Slightman cried out. “Let go of me!”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_744"></a>“Of course, sai Slightman,” Andy said, now sounding solicitous. “I only pressed a small nerve in your elbow, you know. There would be no lasting damage unless I applied at least twenty foot-pounds of pressure.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Why in the hell would you do that?” Slightman sounded injured, almost whiny. “En’t I doing all you could want, and more? En’t I risking my life for my boy?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Not to mention a few little extras,” Andy said silkily. “Your spectacles . . . the music machine you keep deep down in your saddlebag . . . and, of course—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You know why I’m doing it and what’d happen to me if I was found out,” Slightman said. The whine had gone out of his voice. Now he sounded dignified and a little weary. Jake listened to that tone with growing dismay. If he got out of this and had to squeal on Benny’s Da’, he wanted to squeal on a villain. “Yar, I’ve taken a few little extras, you say true, I say thankya. Glasses, so I can see better to betray the people I’ve known all my life. A music machine so I won’t have to hear the conscience you prate about so easy and can get to sleep at night. Then you pinch something in my arm that makes me feel like my by-Riza eyes are going to fall right out of my by-Riza <span class="txit">head</span>.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I allow it from the rest of them,” Andy said, and now his voice had changed. Jake once more thought of Blaine, and once more his dismay grew. What if Tian Jaffords heard <span class="txit">this</span> voice? What if Vaughn Eisenhart heard it? Overholser? The rest of the <span class="txit">folken</span>? “They heap contumely on my head like hot coals and never do I raise a word o’ <a id="page_745"></a>protest, let alone a hand. ‘Go here, Andy. Go there, Andy. Stop yer foolish singing, Andy. Stuff yer prattle. Don’t tell us of the future, because we don’t want to hear it.’ So I don’t, except of the Wolves, because they’d hear what makes em sad and I’d tell em, yes I would; to me each tear’s a drop of gold. ‘You’re nobbut a stupid pile of lights n wires,’ they say. ‘Tell us the weather, sing the babby to sleep, then get t’hell out o’ here.’ And I allow it. Foolish Andy am I, every child’s toy and always fair game for a tongue-whipping. But I won’t take a tongue-whipping from <span class="txit">you,</span> sai. You hope to have a future in the Calla after the Wolves are done with it for another few years, don’t you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You know I do,” Slightman said, so low Jake could barely hear him. “And I deserve it.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You and your son, both say thankya, passing your days in the Calla, both say commala! And that can happen, but it depends on more than the death of the outworlders. <span class="txit">It depends on my silence</span>. If you want it, I demand respect.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“That’s absurd,” Slightman said after a brief pause. From his place in the closet, Jake agreed wholeheartedly. A robot demanding respect <span class="txit">was</span> absurd. But so was a giant bear patrolling an empty forest, a Morlock thug trying to unravel the secrets of dipolar computers, or a train that lived only to hear and solve new riddles. “And besides, hear me I beg, how can I respect you when I don’t even respect myself?”</p>

  <p class="indent">There was a mechanical click in response to this, very loud. Jake had heard Blaine make a similar sound when he—or it—had felt the absurd closing in, threatening to fry his logic circuits. <a id="page_746"></a>Then Andy said: “No answer, nineteen. Connect and report, sai Slightman. Let’s have done with this.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“All right.”</p>

  <p class="indent">There were thirty or forty seconds’ worth of keyboard-clatter, then a high, warbling whistle that made Jake wince and Oy whine far back in his throat. Jake had never heard a sound quite like it; he was from the New York of 1977, and the word <span class="txit">modem</span> would have meant nothing to him.</p>

  <p class="indent">The shriek cut off abruptly. There was a moment’s silence. Then: “THIS IS ALGUL SIENTO. FINLI O’ TEGO HERE. PLEASE GIVE YOUR PASSWORD. YOU HAVE TEN SEC—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Saturday,” Slightman replied, and Jake frowned. Had he ever heard that happy weekend word on this side? He didn’t think so.</p>

  <p class="indent">“THANK YOU. ALGUL SIENTO ACKNOWLEDGES. WE ARE ONLINE.” There was another brief, shrieking whistle. Then: “REPORT, SATURDAY.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Slightman told of watching Roland and “the younger one” going up to the Cave of the Voices, where there was now some sort of door, very likely conjured by the Manni. He said he’d used the far-seer and thus gotten a very good look—</p>

  <p class="indent">“Telescope,” Andy said. He had reverted to his slightly prissy, complacent voice. “Such are called telescopes.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Would <span class="txit">you</span> care to make my report, Andy?” Slightman inquired with cold sarcasm.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Cry pardon,” Andy said in a long-suffering voice. “Cry pardon, cry pardon, go on, go on, as ye will.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_747"></a>There was a pause. Jake could imagine Slightman glaring at the robot, the glare robbed of its ferocity by the way the foreman would have to crane his neck in order to deliver it. Finally he went on.</p>

  <p class="indent">“They left their horses below and walked up. They carried a pink sack which they passed from hand to hand, as if ’twere heavy. Whatever was in it had square edges; I could make that out through the telescope far-seer. May I offer two guesses?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“YES.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“First, they might have been putting two or three of the Pere’s most valuable books in safekeeping. If that’s the case, a Wolf should be sent to destroy them after the main mission’s accomplished.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“WHY?” The voice was perfectly cold. Not a human being’s voice, Jake was sure of that. The sound of it made him feel weak and afraid.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Why, as an example, do it please ya,” Slightman said, as if this should have been obvious. “As an example to the priest!”</p>

  <p class="indent">“CALLAHAN WILL VERY SOON BE BEYOND EXAMPLES,” the voice said. “WHAT IS YOUR OTHER GUESS?”</p>

  <p class="indent">When Slightman spoke again, he sounded shaken. Jake hoped the traitor son of a bitch <span class="txit">was</span> shaken. He was protecting his son, sure, his only son, but why he thought that gave him the right—</p>

  <p class="indent">“It may have been maps,” Slightman said. “I’ve thought long and long that a man who has books is apt to have maps. He may have given em maps of the Eastern Regions leading into Thunderclap—they haven’t been shy about saying that’s where <a id="page_748"></a>they plan to head next. If it is maps they took up there, much good may they do em, even if they live. Next year north’ll be east, and likely the year after it’ll swap places with south.”</p>

  <p class="indent">In the dusty darkness of the closet Jake could suddenly see Andy watching Slightman make his report. Andy’s blue electric eyes were flashing. Slightman didn’t know—no one in the Calla knew—but that rapid flashing was the way DNF-44821-V-63 expressed humor. He was, in fact, laughing at Slightman.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Because he knows better,</span> Jake thought. <span class="txit">Because he knows what’s really in that bag. Bet a box of cookies that he does.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Could he be so sure of that? Was it possible to use the touch on a robot?</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">If it can think,</span> the gunslinger in his head spoke up, <span class="txit">then you can touch it</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Well . . . maybe.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Whatever it was, it’s a damn good indication they really do plan to take the kids into the arroyos,” Slightman was saying. “Not that they’d put em in <span class="txit">that</span> cave.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No, no, not <span class="txit">that</span> cave,” Andy said, and although his voice was as prissy-serious as ever, Jake could imagine his blue eyes flashing even faster. Almost stuttering, in fact. “Too many voices in <span class="txit">that</span> cave, they’d scare the children! Yer-bugger!”</p>

  <p class="indent">DNF-44821-V-63, Messenger Robot. <span class="txit">Messenger!</span> You could accuse Slightman of treachery, but how could anyone accuse Andy of it? What he did, what he <span class="txit">was,</span> had been stamped on his chest for the whole world to see. There it had been, in front of all of them. Gods!</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_749"></a>Benny’s Da’, meanwhile, was plodding stolidly on with his report to Finli o’ Tego, who was in some place called Algul Siento.</p>

  <p class="indent">“The mine he showed us on the map the Taverys drew is the Gloria, and the Gloria en’t but a mile off from the Cave of the Voices. But the bastard’s trig. Can I give another guess?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“YES.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“The arroyo that leads to the Gloria Mine splits off to the south about a quarter-mile in. There’s another old mine at the end of the spur. The Redbird Two, it’s called. Their dinh is telling folks he means to put the kids in the Gloria, and I think he’ll tell em the same at the meeting he’s going to call later this week, the one where he asks leave to stand against the Wolves. But I b’lieve that when the time comes, he’ll stick em in the Redbird instead. He’ll have the Sisters of Oriza standing guard—in front and up above, as well—and ye’d do well not to underestimate those ladies.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“HOW MANY?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I think five, if he puts Sarey Adams among em. Plus some men with bahs. He’ll have the brownie throwing with em, kennit, and I hear she’s good. Maybe best of all. But one way or the other, we know where the kids are going to be. Putting them in such a place is a mistake, but he don’t know it. He’s dangerous, but grown old in his thinking. Probably such a strategy has worked for him before.”</p>

  <p class="indent">And it had, of course. In Eyebolt Canyon, against Latigo’s men.</p>

  <p class="indent">“The important thing now is finding out where he and the boy and the younger man are going to <a id="page_750"></a>be when the Wolves come. He may tell at the meeting. If he don’t, he may tell Eisenhart afterward.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“OR OVERHOLSER?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No. Eisenhart will stand with him. Overholser won’t.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“YOU MUST FIND OUT WHERE THEY’LL BE.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“I know,” Slightman said. “We’ll find out, Andy and I, and then make one more trip to this unblessed place. After that, I swear by the Lady Oriza and the Man Jesus, I’ve done my part. Now can we get out of here?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“In a moment, sai,” Andy said. “I have my own report to make, you know.”</p>

  <p class="indent">There was another of those long, whistling shrieks. Jake ground his teeth and waited for it to be over, and finally it was. Finli o’ Tego signed off.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Are we done?” Slightman asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Unless you have some reason to linger, I believe we are,” Andy said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Does anything in here seem different to you?” Slightman asked suddenly, and Jake felt his blood turn cold.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No,” Andy said, “but I have great respect for human intuition. Are you having intuition, sai?”</p>

  <p class="indent">There was a pause that seemed to go on for at least a full minute, although Jake knew it must have been much shorter than that. He held Oy’s head against his thigh and waited.</p>

  <p class="indent">“No,” Slightman said at last. “Guess I’m just getting jumpy, now that it’s close. God, I wish it was over! I hate this!”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You’re doing the right thing, sai.” Jake didn’t know about Slightman, but Andy’s plummily sympathetic tone made him feel like gnashing his <a id="page_751"></a>teeth. “The <span class="txit">only</span> thing, really. ’Tisn’t your fault that you’re father to the only mateless twin in Calla Bryn Sturgis, is it? I know a song that makes this point in particularly moving fashion. Perhaps you’d like to hear—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Shut up!” Slightman cried in a choked voice. “Shut up, you mechanical devil! I’ve sold my goddam soul, isn’t that enough for you? Must I be made sport of, as well?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“If I’ve offended, I apologize from the bottom of my admittedly hypothetical heart,” Andy said. “In other words, I cry your pardon.” Sounding sincere. Sounding as though he meant every word. Sounding as though butter wouldn’t melt. Yet Jake had no doubt that Andy’s eyes were flashing out in gales of silent blue laughter.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TWELVE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">The conspirators left. There was an odd, meaningless jingle of melody from the overhead speakers (meaningless to Jake, at least), and then silence. He waited for them to discover his pony, come back, search for him, find him, kill him. When he had counted to a hundred and twenty and they hadn’t returned to the Dogan, he got to his feet (the overdose of adrenaline in his system left him feeling as stiff as an old man) and went back into the control room. He was just in time to see the motion-sensor lights in front of the place switch off. He looked at the monitor showing the top of the rise and saw the Dogan’s most recent visitors walking between the boom-flurry. This time the cactuses didn’t move. They had apparently learned their lesson. Jake <a id="page_752"></a>watched Slightman and Andy go, bitterly amused by the difference in their heights. Whenever his father saw such a Mutt-and-Jeff duo on the street, he inevitably said <span class="txit">Put em in vaudeville</span>. It was about as close to a joke as Elmer Chambers could get.</p>

  <p class="indent">When this particular duo was out of sight, Jake looked down at the floor. No dust, of course. No dust and no tracks. He should have seen that when he came in. Certainly <span class="txit">Roland</span> would have seen that. Roland would have seen everything.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake wanted to leave but made himself wait. If they saw the motion-lights glare back on behind them, they’d <span class="txit">probably</span> assume it was a rock-cat (or maybe what Benny called “an armydillo”), but probably wasn’t good enough. To pass the time, he looked at the various control panels, many of which had the LaMerk Industries name on them. Yet he also saw the familiar GE and IBM logos, plus one he didn’t know—Microsoft. All of these latter gadgets were stamped <span class="smallcaps">MADE IN USA</span>. The LaMerk products bore no such mark.</p>

  <p class="indent">He was pretty sure some of the keyboards he saw—there were at least two dozen—controlled computers. What other gadgetry was there? How much was still up and running? Were there weapons stored here? He somehow thought the answer to this last question was no—if there <span class="txit">had</span> been weapons, they had no doubt been decommissioned or appropriated, very likely by Andy the Messenger Robot (Many Other Functions).</p>

  <p class="indent">At last he decided it was safe to leave . . . if, that was, he was extremely careful, rode slowly back to the river, and took pains to approach the Rocking B the back way. He was nearly to the door when <a id="page_753"></a>another question occurred to him. Was there a record of his and Oy’s visit to the Dogan? Were they on videotape somewhere? He looked at the operating TV screens, sparing his longest stare for the one showing the control room. He and Oy were on it again. From the camera’s high angle, anyone in the room would have to be in that picture.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Let it go, Jake,</span> the gunslinger in his head advised. <span class="txit">There’s nothing you can do about it, so just let it go. If you try poking and prying, you’re apt to leave sign. You might even set off an alarm.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">The idea of tripping an alarm convinced him. He picked up Oy—as much for comfort as anything else—and got the hell out. His pony was exactly where Jake had left him, cropping dreamily at the bushes in the moonlight. There were no tracks in the hardpan . . . but, Jake saw, he wasn’t leaving any himself. Andy would have broken through the crusty surface enough to leave tracks, but not him. He wasn’t heavy enough. Probably Benny’s Da’ wasn’t, either.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Quit it. If they’d smelled you, they would have come back</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake supposed that was true, but he still felt more than a little like Goldilocks tiptoeing away from the house of the Three Bears. He led his pony back to the desert road, then put on the duster and slipped Oy into the wide front pocket. As he mounted up, he thumped the bumbler a fairly good one on the saddle-horn.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Ouch, Ake!” Oy said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Quit it, ya baby,” Jake said, turning his pony back in the direction of the river. “Gotta be quiet, now.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_754"></a>“Kiyit,” Oy agreed, and gave him a wink. Jake worked his fingers down through the bumbler’s heavy fur and scratched the place Oy liked the best. Oy closed his eyes, stretched his neck to an almost comical length, and grinned.</p>

  <p class="indent">When they got back to the river, Jake dismounted and peered over a boulder in both directions. He saw nothing, but his heart was in his throat all the way across to the other side. He kept trying to think what he would say if Benny’s Da’ hailed him and asked him what he was doing out here in the middle of the night. Nothing came. In English class, he’d almost always gotten A’s on his creative-writing assignments, but now he was discovering that fear and invention did not mix. If Benny’s Da’ hailed him, Jake would be caught. It was as simple as that.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was no hail—not crossing the river, not going back to the Rocking B, not unsaddling the horse and rubbing him down. The world was silent, and that was just fine with Jake.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">THIRTEEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Once Jake was back on his pallet and pulling the covers to his chin, Oy jumped up on Benny’s bed and lay down, nose once more under his tail. Benny made a deep-sleep muttering sound, reached out, and gave the bumbler’s flank a single stroke.</p>

  <p class="indent">Jake lay looking at the sleeping boy, troubled. He liked Benny—his openness, his appetite for fun, his willingness to work hard when there were chores that needed doing. He liked Benny’s yodeling <a id="page_755"></a>laugh when something struck him funny, and the way they were evenly matched in so many things, and—</p>

  <p class="indent">And until tonight, Jake had liked Benny’s Da’, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">He tried to imagine how Benny would look at him when he found out that (a) his father was a traitor and (b) his friend had squealed on him. Jake thought he could bear anger. It was hurt that would be hard.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">You think hurt’s all it’ll be? Simple hurt? You better think again. There aren’t many props under Benny Slightman’s world, and this is going to knock them all out from under him. Every single one</span>.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Not my fault that his father’s a spy and a traitor.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">But it wasn’t Benny’s, either. If you asked Slightman, he’d probably say it wasn’t even <span class="txit">his</span> fault, that he’d been forced into it. Jake guessed that was almost true. <span class="txit">Completely</span> true, if you looked at things with a father’s eye. What was it that the Calla’s twins made and the Wolves needed? Something in their brains, very likely. Some sort of enzyme or secretion not produced by singleton children; maybe the enzyme or secretion that created the supposed phenomenon of “twin telepathy.” Whatever it was, they could take it from Benny Slightman, because Benny Slightman only <span class="txit">looked</span> like a singleton. Had his sister died? Well, that was tough titty, wasn’t it? <span class="txit">Very</span> tough titty, especially for the father who loved the only one left. Who couldn’t bear to let him go.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Suppose Roland kills him? How will Benny look at you then?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Once, in another life, Roland had promised to take care of Jake Chambers and then let him drop <a id="page_756"></a>into the darkness. Jake had thought there could be no worse betrayal than that. Now he wasn’t so sure. No, not so sure at all. These unhappy thoughts kept him awake for a long time. Finally, half an hour or so before the first hint of dawn touched the horizon, he fell into a thin and troubled sleep.</p>
