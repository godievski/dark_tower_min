  <p class="noindent">The walk from the back yard of the rectory to the front door of Our Lady of Serenity was a short one, taking no more than five minutes. That was surely not enough time for the Old Fella to tell them about the years he had spent on the bum before seeing a news story in the Sacramento <span class="txit">Bee</span> which had brought him back to New York in 1981, and yet the three gunslingers heard the entire tale, nevertheless. Roland suspected that Eddie and Susannah knew what this meant as well as he did: when they moved on from Calla Bryn Sturgis—always assuming they didn’t die here—there was every likelihood that Donald Callahan would be moving on with them. This was not just storytelling but khef, the sharing of water. And, leaving the touch, which was a different matter, to one side, khef could only be shared by those whom destiny had welded together for good or for ill. By those who were ka-tet.</p>

  <p class="indent">Callahan said, “Do you know how folks say, ‘We’re not in Kansas anymore, Toto’?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“The phrase has some vague resonance for us, sugar, yes,” Susannah said dryly.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_385"></a>“Does it? Yes, I see just looking at you that it does. Perhaps you’ll tell me your own story someday. I have an idea it would put mine to shame. In any case, I knew I wasn’t in Kansas anymore as I approached the far end of the footbridge. And it seemed that I wasn’t entering New Jersey, either. At least not the one I’d always expected to find on the other side of the Hudson. There was a newspaper crumpled against the”</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">TWO</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="txit">footrail of the bridge</span>—<span class="txit">which seems completely deserted except for him, although vehicle traffic on the big suspension bridge to his left is heavy and constant</span>—<span class="txit">and Callahan bends to pick it up. The cool wind blowing along the river ruffles his shoulder-length salt-and-pepper hair.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">There’s only one folded sheet, but the top of it’s the front page of the Leabrook</span> Register. <span class="txit">Callahan has never heard of Leabrook. No reason he should have, he’s no New Jersey scholar, hasn’t even been over there since arriving in Manhattan the previous year, but he always thought the town on the other side of the GWB was Fort Lee.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Then his mind is taken over by the headlines. The one across the top seems right enough; <span class="smallcaps">RACIAL TENSIONS IN MIAMI EASE</span>, it reads. The New York papers have been full of these troubles over the last few days. But what to make of <span class="smallcaps">WAR OF KITES CONTINUES IN TEANECK, HACKENSACK</span>, complete with a picture of a burning building? There’s a photo of firemen arriving on a pumper, but they are all laughing! What to make of <span class="smallcaps">PRESIDENT AGNEW SUPPORTS NASA TERRAFORM DREAM</span>? What to make of the item at the bottom, written in Cyrillic?</span></p>

  <p class="indent">What has happened to me? <span class="txit">Callahan asks himself. <a id="page_386"></a>All through the business of the vampires and the walking dead</span>—<span class="txit">even through the appearance of lost-pet posters which clearly refer to him</span>—<span class="txit">he has never questioned his sanity. Now, standing on the New Jersey end of this humble (and most remarkable!) footbridge across the Hudson</span>—<span class="txit">this footbridge which is being utilized by no one except himself</span>—<span class="txit">he finally does. The idea of Spiro Agnew as President is enough all by itself, he thinks, to make anyone with a speck of political sense doubt his sanity. The man resigned in disgrace years ago, even before his boss did.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">What has happened to me? <span class="txit">he wonders, but if he’s a raving lunatic imagining all of this, he really doesn’t want to know.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Bombs away,” he says, and tosses the four-page remnant of the Leabrook</span> Register <span class="txit">over the railing of the bridge. The breeze catches it and carries it away toward the George Washington.</span> That’s reality, <span class="txit">he thinks,</span> right over there. Those cars, those trucks, those Peter Pan charter buses. <span class="txit">But then, among them, he sees a red vehicle that appears to be speeding along on a number of circular treads. Above the vehicle’s body</span>—<span class="txit">it’s about as long as a medium-sized schoolbus</span>—<span class="txit">a crimson cylinder is turning. <span class="smallcaps">BANDY</span>, it says on one side. <span class="smallcaps">BROOKS</span>, it says on the other. <span class="smallcaps">BANDY BROOKS</span>. Or <span class="smallcaps">BANDYBROOKS</span>. What the hell’s Bandy Brooks? He has no idea. Nor has he ever seen such a vehicle in his life, and would not have believed such a thing</span>—<span class="txit">look at the</span> treads, <span class="txit">for heaven’s sake</span>—<span class="txit">would have been allowed on a public highway.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">So the George Washington Bridge isn’t the safe world, either. Or not anymore.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Callahan grabs the railing of the footbridge and squeezes down tightly as a wave of dizziness courses through him, making him feel unsteady on his feet and <a id="page_387"></a>unsure of his balance. The railing feels real enough, wood warmed by the sun and engraved with thousands of interlocking initials and messages. He sees <span class="smallcaps">DK L MB</span> in a heart. He sees <span class="smallcaps">FREDDY</span> &amp; <span class="smallcaps">HELENA = TRU LUV</span>. He sees <span class="smallcaps">KILL ALL SPIX AND NIGERS</span>, the message flanked by swastikas, and wonders at verbal depletion so complete the sufferer cannot even spell his favorite epithets. Messages of hate, messages of love, and all of them as real as the rapid beating of his heart or the weight of the few coins and bills in the right front pocket of his jeans. He takes a deep breath of the breeze, and that’s real, too, right down to the tang of diesel fuel.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">This is happening to me, I know it is, <span class="txit">he thinks.</span> I am <span class="txit">not</span> in some psychiatric hospital’s Ward 9. I am me, I am here, and I’m even sober—at least for the time being—and New York is at my back. So is the town of Jerusalem’s Lot, Maine, with its uneasy dead. Before me is the weight of America, with all its possibilities.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">This thought lifts him, and is followed by one that lifts him even higher: not just one America, perhaps, but a dozen</span> . . . <span class="txit">or a thousand</span> . . . <span class="txit">or a million. If that’s Leabrook over there instead of Fort Lee, maybe there’s another version of New Jersey where the town on the other side of the Hudson is Leeman or Leighman or Lee Bluffs or Lee Palisades or Leghorn Village. Maybe instead of forty-two continental United States on the other side of the Hudson, there are forty-two hundred, or forty-two</span> thousand, <span class="txit">all of them stacked in vertical geographies of chance.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">And he understands instinctively that this is almost certainly true. He has stumbled upon a great, possibly endless, confluence of worlds. They are all America, but they are all different. There are highways which lead through them,</span> and he can see them.</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_388"></a><span class="txit">He walks rapidly to the Leabrook end of the footbridge, then pauses again.</span> Suppose I can’t find my way back? <span class="txit">he thinks.</span> Suppose I get lost and wander and never find my way back to the America where Fort Lee is on the west side of the George Washington Bridge and Gerald Ford (of all people!) is the President of the United States?</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">And then he thinks:</span> So what if I do? So fucking what?</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">When he steps off on the Jersey side of the footbridge he’s grinning, truly lighthearted for this first time since the day he presided over Danny Glick’s grave in the town of Jerusalem’s Lot. A couple of boys with fishing poles are walking toward him. “Would one of you young fellows care to welcome me to New Jersey?” Callahan asks, grinning more widely than ever.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Welcome to En-Jay, man,” one of them says, willingly enough, but both of them give Callahan a wide berth and a careful look. He doesn’t blame them, but it doesn’t cut into his splendid mood in the slightest. He feels like a man who has been let out of a gray and cheerless prison on a sunny day. He begins to walk faster, not turning around to give the skyline of Manhattan a single goodbye glance. Why would he? Manhattan is the past. The multiple Americas which lie ahead of him, those are the future.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">He is in Leabrook. There are no chimes. Later there will be chimes and vampires; later there will be more messages chalked on sidewalks and sprayed on brick walls (not all about him, either). Later he will see the low men in their outrageous red Cadillacs and green Lincolns and purple Mercedes-Benz sedans, low men with red flashgun eyes, but not today. Today there is sunshine in a new America on the west side of a restored footbridge across the Hudson.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">On Main Street he stops in front of the Leabrook Homestyle <a id="page_389"></a>Diner and there is a sign in the window reading <span class="smallcaps">SHORT-ORDER COOK WANTED</span>. Don Callahan short-ordered through most of his time at seminary and did more than his share of the same at Home on the East Side of Manhattan. He thinks he might fit right in here at the Leabrook Homestyle. Turns out he’s right, although it takes three shifts before the ability to crack a pair of eggs one-handed onto the grill comes swimming back to him. The owner, a long drink of water named Dicky Rudebacher, asks Callahan if he has any medical problems</span>—<span class="txit">“catching stuff,” he calls it</span>—<span class="txit">and nods simple acceptance when Callahan says he doesn’t. He doesn’t ask Callahan for any paperwork, not so much as a Social Security number. He wants to pay his new short-order off the books, if that’s not a problem. Callahan assures him it is not.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“One more thing,” says Dicky Rudebacher, and Callahan waits for the shoe to drop. Nothing would surprise him, but all Rudebacher says is: “You look like a drinking man.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Callahan allows as how he has been known to take a drink.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“So have I,” Rudebacher says. “In this business it’s the way you protect your gahdam sanity. I ain’t gonna smell your breath when you come in</span> . . . <span class="txit">if you come in on time. Miss coming in on time twice, though, and you’re on your way to wherever. I ain’t going to tell you that again.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Callahan short-orders at the Leabrook Homestyle Diner for three weeks, and stays two blocks down at the Sunset Motel. Only it’s not always the Homestyle, and it’s not always the Sunset. On his fourth day in town, he wakes up in the Sun</span>rise <span class="txit">Motel, and the Leabrook Homestyle Diner is the Fort Lee Homestyle Diner. The Leabrook</span> Register <span class="txit">which people have been leaving behind on the counter becomes the Fort Lee</span> Register-American. <span class="txit">He is <a id="page_390"></a>not exactly relieved to discover Gerald Ford has reassumed the Presidency.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">When Rudebacher pays him at the end of his first week</span>—<span class="txit">in Fort Lee</span>—<span class="txit">Grant is on the fifties, Jackson is on the twenties, and Alexander Hamilton is on the single ten in the envelope the boss hands him. At the end of the second week</span>—<span class="txit">in Leabrook</span>—<span class="txit">Abraham Lincoln is on the fifties and someone named Chadbourne is on the ten. It’s still Andrew Jackson on the twenties, which is something of a relief. In Callahan’s motel room, the bedcover is pink in Leabrook and orange in Fort Lee. This is handy. He always knows which version of New Jersey he’s in as soon as he wakes up.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Twice he gets drunk. The second time, after closing, Dicky Rudebacher joins him and matches him drink for drink. “This used to be a great country,” the Leabrook version of Rudebacher mourns, and Callahan thinks how great it is that some things don’t change; the fundamental bitch-and-moans apply as time goes by.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">But his shadow starts getting longer earlier each day, he has seen his first Type Three vampire waiting in line to buy a ticket at the Leabrook Twin Cinema, and one day he gives notice.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Thought you told me you didn’t have anything,” Rudebacher says to Callahan.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Beg your pardon?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“You’ve got a bad case of itchy-foot, my friend. It often goes with the other thing.” Rudebacher makes a bottle-tipping gesture with one dishwater-reddened hand. “When a man catches itchy-foot late in life, it’s often incurable. Tell you what, if I didn’t have a wife that’s still a pretty good lay and two kids in college, I might just pack me a bindle and join you.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Yeah?” Callahan asks, fascinated.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_391"></a><span class="txit">“September and October are always the worst,” Rudebacher says dreamily. “You just hear it calling. The birds hear it, too, and go.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“It?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Rudebacher gives him a look that says don’t be stupid. “With them it’s the sky. Guys like us, it’s the road. Call of the open fuckin road. Guys like me, kids in school and a wife that still likes it more than just on Saturday night, they turn up the radio a little louder and drown it out. You’re not gonna do that.” He pauses, looks at Callahan shrewdly. “Stay another week? I’ll bump you twenty-five bucks. You make a gahdam fine Monte Cristo.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Callahan considers, then shakes his head. If Rudebacher was right, if it was only one road, maybe he would stay another week</span> . . . <span class="txit">and another</span> . . . <span class="txit">and another. But it’s not just one. It’s all of them, all those highways in hiding, and he remembers the name of his third-grade reader and bursts out laughing. It was called</span> Roads to Everywhere.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“What’s so funny?” Rudebacher asks sourly.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Nothing,” Callahan says. “Everything.” He claps his boss on the shoulder. “You’re a good man, Dicky. If I get back this way, I’ll stop in.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“You won’t get back this way,” Dicky Rudebacher says, and of course he is right.</span></p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">THREE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">“I was five years on the road, give or take,” Callahan said as they approached his church, and in a way that was all he said on the subject. Yet they heard more. Nor were they surprised later to find that Jake, on his way into town with Eisenhart and <a id="page_392"></a>the Slightmans, had heard some of it, too. It was Jake, after all, who was strongest in the touch.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Five years on the road,</span> no more than that.</p>

  <p class="indent">And all the rest, do ya ken: a thousand lost worlds of the rose.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">FOUR</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="txit">He’s five years on the road, give or take, only there’s a lot more than one road and maybe, under the right circumstances, five years can be forever.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">There is Route 71 through Delaware and apples to pick. There’s a little boy named Lars with a broken radio. Callahan fixes it and Lars’s mother packs him a great and wonderful lunch to go on with, a lunch that seems to last for days. There is Route 317 through rural Kentucky, and a job digging graves with a fellow named Pete Petacki who won’t shut up. A girl comes to watch them, a pretty girl of seventeen or so, sitting on a rock wall with yellow leaves raining down all around her, and Pete Petacki speculates on what it would be like to have those long thighs stripped of the corduroys they’re wearing and wrapped around his neck, what it would be like to be tongue-deep in jailbait. Pete Petacki doesn’t see the blue light around her, and he certainly doesn’t see the way her clothes drift to the ground like feathers later on, when Callahan sits beside her, then draws her close as she slips a hand up his leg and her mouth onto his throat, then thrusts his knife unerringly into the bulge of bone and nerve and gristle at the back of her neck. This is a shot he’s getting very good at.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">There is Route 19 through West Virginia, and a little road-dusty carnival that’s looking for a man who can fix the rides and feed the animals. “Or the other way around,” says Greg Chumm, the carny’s greasy-haired <a id="page_393"></a>owner. “You know, feed the rides and fix the animals. Whatever floats ya boat.” And for awhile, when a strep infection leaves the carny shorthanded (they are swinging down south by now, trying to stay ahead of winter), he finds himself also playing Menso the ESP Wonder, and with surprising success. It is also as Menso that he first sees</span> them, <span class="txit">not vampires and not bewildered dead people but tall men with pale, watchful faces that are usually hidden under old-fashioned hats with brims or new-fashioned baseball hats with extra-long bills. In the shadows thrown by these hats, their eyes flare a dusky red, like the eyes of coons or polecats when you catch them in the beam of a flashlight, lurking around your trash barrels. Do</span> they <span class="txit">see</span> him? <span class="txit">The vampires (the Type Threes, at least) do not. The dead people do. And these men, with their hands stuffed into the pockets of their long yellow coats and their hardcase faces peering out from beneath their hats? Do they see? Callahan doesn’t know for sure but decides to take no chances. Three days later, in the town of Yazoo City, Mississippi, he hangs up his black Menso tophat, leaves his greasy coverall on the floor of a pickup truck’s camper cap, and blows Chumm’s Traveling Wonder Show, not bothering with the formality of his final paycheck. On his way out of town, he sees a number of those pet posters nailed to telephone poles. A typical one reads:</span></p>

  <p class="centerl"><span class="txit">LOST! SIAMESE CAT, 2 YRS OLD<br class="calibre1" />
  ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF RUTA<br class="calibre1" />

  GOD BLESS YOU FOR HELPING</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_394"></a><span class="txit">Who is Ruta? Callahan doesn’t know. All he knows is that she is <span class="font">NOISY</span> but</span> <span class="font">FULL OF FUN</span>. <span class="txit">Will she still be noisy when the low men catch up to her? Will she still be full of fun?</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Callahan doubts it.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">But he has his own problems and all he can do is pray to the God in whom he no longer strictly believes that the men in the yellow coats won’t catch up to her.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Later that day, thumbing on the side of Route 3 in Issaquena County under a hot gunmetal sky that knows nothing of December and approaching Christmas, the chimes come again. They fill his head, threatening to pop his eardrums and blow pinprick hemorrhages across the entire surface of his brain. As they fade, a terrible certainty grips him: they are coming. The men with the red eyes and big hats and long yellow coats are on their way.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Callahan bolts from the side of the road like a chaingang runaway, clearing the pond-scummy ditch like Superman: at a single bound. Beyond is an old stake fence overgrown with drifts of kudzu and what might be poison sumac. He doesn’t care if it’s poison sumac or not. He dives over the fence, rolls over in high grass and burdocks, and peers out at the highway through a hole in the foliage.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">For a moment or two there’s nothing. Then a white-over-red Cadillac comes pounding down Highway 3 from the direction of Yazoo City. It’s doing seventy easy, and Callahan’s peephole is small, but he still sees them with supernatural clarity: three men, two in what appear to be yellow dusters, the third in what might be a flight-jacket. All three are smoking; the Cadillac’s closed cabin fumes with it.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">They’ll see me they’ll hear me they’ll sense me, <span class="txit">Callahan’s mind yammers, and he forces it away from its own panicky wretched certainty,</span> yanks <span class="txit">it away. He forces <a id="page_395"></a>himself to think of that Elton John song</span>—<span class="txit">“Someone saved, someone saved, someone saved my</span> li-iife <span class="txit">tonight</span> . . . ” <span class="txit">and it seems to work. There is one terrible, heart-stopping moment when he thinks the Caddy is slowing</span>—<span class="txit">long enough for him to imagine them chasing him through this weedy, forgotten field, chasing him down, dragging him into an abandoned shed or barn</span>—<span class="txit">and then the Caddy roars over the next hill, headed for Natchez, maybe. Or Copiah. Callahan waits another ten minutes. “Got to make sure they’re not trickin on you, man,” Lupe might have said. But even as he waits, he knows this is only a formality. They’re not trickin on him; they flat missed him. How? Why?</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">The answer dawns on him slowly</span>—an <span class="txit">answer, at least, and he’s damned if it doesn’t feel like the right one. They missed him because he was able to slip into a different version of America as he lay behind the tangle of kudzu and sumac, peering out at Route 3. Maybe different in only a few small details</span>—<span class="txit">Lincoln on the one and Washington on the five instead of the other way around, let us say</span>—<span class="txit">but enough. Just enough. And that’s good, because these guys aren’t brain-blasted, like the dead folks, or blind to him, like the bloodsucking folks. These people, whoever they are, are the most dangerous of all.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Finally, Callahan goes back out to the road. Eventually a black man in a straw hat and overalls comes driving along in an old beat-up Ford. He looks so much like a Negro farmer from a thirties movie that Callahan almost expects him to laugh and slap his knee and give out occasional cries of</span> “Yassuh, <span class="txit">boss! Ain’t</span> dat <span class="txit">de troof!” Instead, the black man engages him in a discussion about politics prompted by an item on National Public Radio, to which he is listening. And when Callahan leaves him, in Shady Grove, the black man gives him five dollars and a spare baseball cap.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_396"></a><span class="txit">“I have money,” Callahan says, trying to give back the five.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“A man on the run never has enough,” says the black man. “And please don’t tell me you’re not on the run. Don’t insult my intelligence.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“I thank you,” Callahan says.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">“De nada, <span class="txit">” says the black man. “Where are you going? Roughly speaking?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“I don’t have a clue,” Callahan replies, then smiles. “Roughly speaking.”</span></p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">FIVE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="txit">Picking oranges in Florida. Pushing a broom in New Orleans. Mucking out horse-stalls in Lufkin, Texas. Handing out real estate brochures on streetcorners in Phoenix, Arizona. Working jobs that pay cash. Observing the ever-changing faces on the bills. Noting the different names in the papers. Jimmy Carter is elected President, but so are Ernest “Fritz” Hollings and Ronald Reagan. George Bush is also elected President. Gerald Ford decides to run again and</span> he <span class="txit">is elected President. The names in the papers (those of the celebrities change the most frequently, and there are many he has never heard of) don’t matter. The faces on the currency don’t matter. What matters is the sight of a weathervane against a violent pink sunset, the sound of his heels on an empty road in Utah, the sound of the wind in the New Mexico desert, the sight of a child skipping rope beside a junked-out Chevrolet Caprice in Fossil, Oregon. What matters is the whine of the powerlines beside Highway 50 west of Elko, Nevada, and a dead crow in a ditch outside Rainbarrel Springs. Sometimes he’s sober and sometimes he gets drunk. Once he lays up in an abandoned shed</span>—<span class="txit">this is just over the <a id="page_397"></a>California state line from Nevada</span>—<span class="txit">and drinks for four days straight. It ends with seven hours of off-and-on vomiting. For the first hour or so, the puking is so constant and so violent he is convinced it will kill him. Later on, he can only wish it would. And when it’s over, he swears to himself that he’s done, no more booze for him, he’s finally learned his lesson, and a week later he’s drunk again and staring up at the strange stars behind the restaurant where he has hired on as a dishwasher. He is an animal in a trap and he doesn’t care. Sometimes there are vampires and sometimes he kills them. Mostly he lets them live, because he’s afraid of drawing attention to himself</span>—<span class="txit">the attention of the low men. Sometimes he asks himself what he thinks he’s doing, where the hell he’s going, and such questions are apt to send him in search of the next bottle in a hurry. Because he’s really not going anywhere. He’s just following the highways in hiding and dragging his trap along behind him, he’s just listening to the call of those roads and going from one to the next. Trapped or not, sometimes he is happy; sometimes he sings in his chains like the sea. He wants to see the next weathervane standing against the next pink sunset. He wants to see the next silo crumbling at the end of some disappeared farmer’s long-abandoned north field and see the next droning truck with <span class="smallcaps">TONOPAH GRAVEL</span> or <span class="smallcaps">ASPLUNDH HEAVY CONSTRUCTION</span> written on the side. He’s in hobo heaven, lost in the split personalities of America. He wants to hear the wind in canyons and know that he’s the only one who hears it. He wants to scream and hear the echoes run away. When the taste of Barlow’s blood is too strong in his mouth, he wants to drink. And, of course, when he sees the lost-pet posters or the messages chalked on the sidewalks, he wants to move on. Out west he sees fewer of them, and neither his name nor his description is on <a id="page_398"></a>any of them. From time to time he sees vampires cruising</span>—<span class="txit">give us this day our daily blood</span>—<span class="txit">but he leaves them be. They’re mosquitoes, after all, no more than that.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">In the spring of 1981 he finds himself rolling into the city of Sacramento in the back of what may be the oldest International Harvester stake-bed truck still on the road in California. He’s crammed in with roughly three dozen Mexican illegals, there is</span> mescal <span class="txit">and tequila and pot and several bottles of wine, they’re all drunk and done up and Callahan is perhaps the drunkest of them all. The names of his companions come back to him in later years like names spoken in a haze of fever: Escobar</span> . . . <span class="txit">Estrada</span> . . . <span class="txit">Javier</span> . . . <span class="txit">Esteban</span> . . . <span class="txit">Rosario</span> . . . <span class="txit">Echeverria</span> . . . <span class="txit">Caverra. Are they all names he will later encounter in the Calla, or is that just a booze-hallucination? For that matter, what is he to make of his own name, which is so close to that of the place where he finishes up?</span> Calla, Callahan. Calla, Callahan. <span class="txit">Sometimes, when he’s long getting to sleep in his pleasant rectory bed, the two names chase each other in his head like the tigers in</span> Little Black Sambo.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Sometimes a line of poetry comes to him, a paraphrase from (he thinks) Archibald MacLeish’s “Epistle to Be Left in Earth.”</span> It was not the voice of God but only the thunder. <span class="txit">That’s not right, but it’s how he remembers it</span>. Not God but the thunder. <span class="txit">Or is that only what he wants to believe? How many times has God been denied just that way?</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">In any case, all of that comes later. When he rolls into Sacramento he’s drunk and he’s happy. There are no questions in his mind. He’s even halfway happy the next day, hangover and all. He finds a job easily; jobs are everywhere, it seems, lying around like apples after a windstorm has gone through the orchard. As long as you don’t mind getting your hands dirty, that is, or scalded by hot water or <a id="page_399"></a>sometimes blistered by the handle of an ax or a shovel; in his years on the road no one has ever offered him a stockbroker’s job.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">The work he gets in Sacramento is unloading trucks at a block-long bed-and-mattress store called Sleepy John’s. Sleepy John is preparing for his once-yearly Mattre$$ Ma$$acre, and all morning long Callahan and a crew of five other men haul in the kings and queens and doubles. Compared to some of the day-labor he’s done over the last years, this job is a tit.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">At lunch, Callahan and the rest of the men sit in the shade of the loading dock. So far as he can tell, there’s no one in this crew from the International Harvester, but he wouldn’t swear to it; he was awfully drunk. All he knows for sure is that he’s once again the only guy present with a white skin. All of them are eating enchiladas from Crazy Mary’s down the road. There’s a dirty old boombox sitting on a pile of crates, playing salsa. Two young men tango together while the others</span>—<span class="txit">Callahan included</span>—<span class="txit">put aside their lunches so they can clap along.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">A young woman in a skirt and blouse comes out, watches the men dance disapprovingly, then looks at Callahan. “You’re anglo, right?” she says.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Anglo as the day is long,” Callahan agrees.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Then maybe you’d like this. Certainly no good to the rest of them.” She hands him the newspaper</span>—<span class="txit">the Sacramento</span> Bee—<span class="txit">then looks at the dancing Mexicans. “Beaners,” she says, and the subtext is in the tone: What can you do?</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Callahan considers rising to his feet and kicking her narrow can’t-dance anglo ass for her, but it’s noon, too late in the day to get another job if he loses this one. And even if he doesn’t wind up in the</span> calabozo <span class="txit">for assault, he won’t get paid. He settles for giving her turned back the finger, and <a id="page_400"></a>laughs when several of the men applaud. The young woman wheels, looks at them suspiciously, then goes back inside. Still grinning, Callahan shakes open the paper. The grin lasts until he gets to the page marked <span class="smallcaps">NATIONAL BRIEFS</span>, then fades in a hurry. Between a story about a train derailment in Vermont and a bank robbery in Missouri, he finds this:</span></p>

  <p class="centera1">AWARD-WINNING “STREET ANGEL” CRITICAL</p>

  <p class="blocki">NEW YORK (AP) Rowan R. Magruder, owner and Chief Supervisor of what may be America’s most highly regarded shelter for the homeless, alcoholic, and drug-addicted, is in critical condition after being assaulted by the so-called Hitler Brothers. The Hitler Brothers have been operating in the five boroughs of New York for at least eight years. According to police, they are believed responsible for over three dozen assaults and the deaths of two men. Unlike their other victims, Magruder is neither black nor Jewish, but he was found in a doorway not far from Home, the shelter he founded in 1968, with the Hitler Brothers’ trademark swastika cut into his forehead. Magruder had also suffered multiple stab-wounds.</p>

  <p class="blocki">Home gained nationwide notice in 1977, when Mother Teresa visited, helped to serve dinner, and prayed with the clients. Magruder himself was the subject of a <span class="txit">Newsweek</span> cover story in 1980, when the East Side’s so-called “Street Angel” was named Manhattan’s Man of the Year by Mayor Ed Koch.</p>

  <p class="blocki">A doctor familiar with the case rated Magruder’s chances of pulling through as “no higher than three in ten.” He said that, as well as being branded, Magruder was blinded by his assailants. “I think of <a id="page_401"></a>myself as a merciful man,” the doctor said, “but in my opinion, the men who did this should be beheaded.”</p>

  <p class="indenta"><span class="txit">Callahan reads the article again, wondering if this is “his” Rowan Magruder or another one</span>—<span class="txit">a Rowan Magruder from a world where a guy named Chadbourne is on some of the greenbacks, say. He’s somehow sure that it’s his, and that he was meant to see this particular item. Certainly he is in what he thinks of as the “real world” now, and it’s not just the thin sheaf of currency in his wallet that tells him so. It’s a feeling, a kind of tone. A truth. If so (and it</span> is <span class="txit">so, he knows it), how much he has missed out here on the hidden highways. Mother Teresa came to visit! Helped to ladle out soup! Hell, for all Callahan knows, maybe she cooked up a big old mess of Toads n Dumplins! Could’ve; the recipe was right there, Scotch-taped to the wall beside the stove. And an award! The cover of</span> Newsweek! <span class="txit">He’s pissed he didn’t see that, but you don’t see the news magazines very regularly when you’re traveling with the carnival and fixing the Krazy Kups or mucking out the bull-stalls behind the rodeo in Enid, Oklahoma.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">He is so deeply ashamed that he doesn’t even</span> know <span class="txit">he’s ashamed. Not even when Juan Castillo says, “Why joo crine, Donnie?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Am I?” he asks, and wipes underneath his eyes, and yeah, he is. He is crying. But he doesn’t know it’s for shame, not then. He assumes it’s shock, and probably part of it is. “Yeah, I guess I am.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“Where joo goan?” Juan persists. “Lunch break’s almost over, man.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“I have to leave,” Callahan says. “I have to go back east.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“You take off, they ain goan pay joo.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">“I know,” Callahan says. “It’s okay.”</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">And what a lie that is. Because nothing’s okay.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Nothing.</span></p>

  <h3 class="h2"><a class="calibre2" id="page_402"></a><span class="smallcaps1">SIX</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">“I had a couple of hundred dollars sewn into the bottom of my backpack,” Callahan said. They were now sitting on the steps of the church in the bright sunshine. “I bought an airplane ticket back to New York. Speed was of the essence—of course—but that really wasn’t the only reason. I had to get off those highways in hiding.” He gave Eddie a small nod. “The todash turnpikes. They’re as addictive as the booze—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“More,” Roland said. He saw three figures coming toward them: Rosalita, shepherding the Tavery twins, Frank and Francine. The girl had a large sheet of paper in her hands and was carrying it out in front of her with an air of reverence that was almost comic. “Wandering’s the most addictive drug there is, I think, and every hidden road leads on to a dozen more.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You say true, I say thankya,” Callahan replied. He looked gloomy and sad and, Roland thought, a little lost.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Pere, we’d hear the rest of your tale, but I’d have you save it until evening. Or tomorrow evening, if we don’t get back until then. Our young friend Jake will be here shortly—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You know that, do you?” Callahan asked, interested but not disbelieving.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aye,” Susannah said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“I’d see what you have in there before he comes,” Roland said. “The story of how you came by it is part of <span class="txit">your</span> story, I think—”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” Callahan said. “It is. The <span class="txit">point</span> of my story, I think.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_403"></a>“—and must wait its place. As for now, things are stacking up.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“They have a way of doing that,” Callahan said. “For months—sometimes even years, as I tried to explain to you—time hardly seems to exist. Then everything comes in a gasp.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“You say true,” Roland said. “Step over with me to see the twins, Eddie. I believe the young lady has her eye on you.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“She can look as much as she wants,” Susannah said good-humoredly. “Lookin’s free. I might just sit here in the sun on these steps, Roland, if it’s all the same to you. Been a long time since I rode, and I don’t mind telling you that I’m saddle-sore. Not having any lower pins seems to put everything else out of whack.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Do ya either way,” Roland said, but he didn’t mean it and Eddie knew he didn’t. The gunslinger wanted Susannah to stay right where she was, for the time being. He could only hope Susannah wasn’t catching the same vibe.</p>

  <p class="indent">As they walked toward the children and Rosalita, Roland spoke to Eddie, low and quick. “I’m going into the church with him by myself. Just know that it’s not the both of you I want to keep away from whatever’s in there. If it <span class="txit">is</span> Black Thirteen—and I believe it must be—it’s best she not go near it.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Given her delicate condition, you mean. Roland, I would have thought Suze having a miscarriage would almost be something you’d want.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland said: “It’s not a miscarriage that concerns me. I’m worried about Black Thirteen making the thing inside her even stronger.” He paused again. <a id="page_404"></a>“<span class="txit">Both</span> things, mayhap. The baby and the baby’s keeper.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Mia.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes, her.” Then he smiled at the Tavery twins. Francine gave him a perfunctory smile in return, saving full wattage for Eddie.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Let me see what you’ve made, if you would,” Roland said.</p>

  <p class="indent">Frank Tavery said, “We hope it’s all right. Might not be. We were afraid, do ya. It’s such a wonderful piece of paper the missus gave us, we were afraid.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“We drew on the ground first,” Francine said. “Then in lightest char. ’Twas Frank did the final; my hands were all a-shake.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“No fear,” Roland said. Eddie drew close and looked over his shoulder. The map was a marvel of detail, with the Town Gathering Hall and the common at the center and the Big River/Devar-Tete running along the left side of the paper, which looked to Eddie like an ordinary mimeo sheet. The kind available by the ream at any office supply store in America.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Kids, this is absolutely terrific,” Eddie said, and for a moment he thought Francine Tavery might actually faint.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aye,” Roland said. “You’ve done a great service. And now I’m going to do something that will probably look like blasphemy to you. You know the word?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” Frank said. “We’re Christians. ‘Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God or His Son, the Man Jesus, in vain.’ But blasphemy is also to commit a rude act upon a thing of beauty.”</p>

  <p class="indent">His tone was deeply serious, but he looked interested <a id="page_405"></a>to see what blasphemy the outworlder meant to commit. His sister did, too.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland folded the paper—which they had almost dared not touch, in spite of their obvious skill—in half. The children gasped. So did Rosalita Munoz, although not quite as loudly.</p>

  <p class="indent">“It’s not blasphemy to treat it so because it’s no longer just paper,” Roland said. “It has become a tool, and tools must be protected. D’ye ken?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes,” they said, but doubtfully. Their confidence was at least partly restored by the care with which Roland stowed the folded map in his purse.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Thankya big-big,” Roland said. He took Francine’s hand in his left, Frank’s in his diminished right. “You may have saved lives with your hands and eyes.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Francine burst into tears. Frank held his own back until he grinned. Then they overspilled and ran down his freckled cheeks.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">SEVEN</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Walking back to the church steps, Eddie said: “Good kids. Talented kids.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland nodded.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Can you see one of them coming back from Thunderclap a drooling idiot?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland, who could see it all too well, made no reply.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><span class="smallcaps1">EIGHT</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">Susannah accepted Roland’s decision that she and Eddie should stay outside the church with no argument, and the gunslinger found himself remembering her reluctance to enter the vacant lot. He <a id="page_406"></a>wondered if part of her was afraid of the same thing he was. If that was the case, the battle—<span class="txit">her</span> battle—had already begun.</p>

  <p class="indent">“How long before I come in and drag you out?” Eddie asked.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Before <span class="txit">we</span> come in and drag you out?” Susannah corrected him.</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland considered. It was a good question. He looked at Callahan, who stood on the top step in blue jeans and a plaid shirt rolled to the elbows. His hands were clasped in front of him. Roland saw good muscle on those forearms.</p>

  <p class="indent">The Old Fella shrugged. “It sleeps. There should be no problem. But—” He unlocked one of his gnarled hands and pointed at the gun on Roland’s hip. “I sh’d ditch that. Mayhap it sleeps with one eye open.”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland unbuckled the gunbelt and handed it to Eddie, who was wearing the other one. Then he unslung his purse and handed it to Susannah. “Five minutes,” he said. “If there’s trouble, I might be able to call.” <span class="txit">Or I might not,</span> he didn’t add.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Jake should be here by then,” Eddie said.</p>

  <p class="indent">“If they come, hold them out here,” Roland told him.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Eisenhart and the Slightmans won’t try to come in,” Callahan said. “What worship they have is for Oriza. Lady Rice.” He grimaced to show what he thought of Lady Rice and the rest of the Calla’s second-rate gods.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Let’s go, then,” Roland said.</p>

  <h3 class="h2"><a class="calibre2" id="page_407"></a><span class="smallcaps1">NINE</span></h3>

  <p class="noindent">It had been a long time since Roland Deschain had been afraid in the deeply superstitious way that goes with a believed religion. Since his childhood, perhaps. But fear fell upon him as soon as Pere Callahan opened the door of his modest wooden church and held it, gesturing for Roland to precede him inside.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was a foyer with a faded rug on the floor. On the other side of the foyer, two doors stood open. Beyond them was a largish room with pews on each side and kneelers on the floor. At the room’s far end was a raised platform and what Roland thought of as a lectern flanked by pots of white flowers. Their mild scent pervaded the still air. There were narrow windows of clear glass. Behind the lectern, on the far wall, was an ironwood cross.</p>

  <p class="indent">He could hear the Old Fella’s secret treasure, not with his ears but with his bones. A steady low hum. Like the rose, that hum conveyed a sense of power, but it was like the rose in no other way. This hum spoke of colossal emptiness. A void like the one they had all sensed behind the surface reality of todash New York. A void that could become a voice.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Yes, this is what took us,</span> he thought. <span class="txit">It took us to New York</span>—<span class="txit">one New York of many, according to Callahan’s story</span>—<span class="txit">but it could take us anywhere or anywhen. It could take us</span> . . . <span class="txit">or it could fling us.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">He remembered the conclusion of his long palaver with Walter, in the place of the bones. He had gone todash then, too; he understood that now. And there had been a sense of growing, of <a id="page_408"></a><span class="txit">swelling,</span> until he had been bigger than the earth, the stars, the very universe itself. That power was here, in this room, and he was afraid of it.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Gods grant it sleep,</span> he thought, but the thought was followed by an even more dismaying one: sooner or later they would have to wake it up. Sooner or later they would have to use it to get back to the New York whens they needed to visit.</p>

  <p class="indent">There was a bowl of water on a stand beside the door. Callahan dipped his fingers, then crossed himself.</p>

  <p class="indent">“You can do that now?” Roland murmured in what was little more than a whisper.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aye,” Callahan said. “God has taken me back, gunslinger. Although I think only on what might be called ‘a trial basis.’ Do you ken?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Roland nodded. He followed Callahan into the church without dipping his fingers in the font.</p>

  <p class="indent">Callahan led him down the center aisle, and although he moved swiftly and surely, Roland sensed the man was as frightened as Roland was himself, perhaps more. The religious wanted to be rid of the thing, of course, there was that, but Roland still gave him high marks for courage.</p>

  <p class="indent">On the far right side of the preacher’s cove was a little flight of three steps. Callahan mounted them. “No need for you to come up, Roland; you can see well enough from where you are. You’d not have it this minute, I ken?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Not at all,” Roland said. Now they <span class="txit">were</span> whispering.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Good.” Callahan dropped to one knee. There was an audible pop as the joint flexed, and they both started at the sound. “I’d not even touch the <a id="page_409"></a>box it’s in, if I don’t have to. I haven’t since I put it here. The hidey-hole I made myself, asking God’s pardon for using a saw in His house.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Take it up,” Roland said. He was on complete alert, every sense drawn fine, feeling and listening for any slightest change in that endless void hum. He missed the weight of the gun on his hip. Did the people who came here to worship not sense the terrible thing the Old Fella had hidden here? He supposed they must not, or they’d stay away. And he supposed there was really no better place for such a thing; the simple faith of the parishioners might neutralize it to some degree. Might even soothe it and thus deepen its doze.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">But it could wake up,</span> Roland thought. <span class="txit">Wake up and send them all to the nineteen points of nowhere in the blink of an eye.</span> This was an especially terrible thought, and he turned his mind from it. Certainly the idea of using it to secure protection for the rose seemed more and more like a bitter joke. He had faced both men and monsters in his time, but had never been close to anything like this. The sense of its evil was terrible, almost unmanning. The sense of its malevolent emptiness was far, far worse.</p>

  <p class="indent">Callahan pressed his thumb into the groove between two boards. There was a faint click and a section of the preacher’s cove popped out of place. Callahan pulled the boards free, revealing a square hole roughly fifteen inches long and wide. He rocked back on his haunches, holding the boards across his chest. The hum was much louder now. Roland had a brief image of a gigantic hive with <a id="page_410"></a>bees the size of waggons crawling sluggishly over it. He bent forward and looked into the Old Fella’s hidey-hole.</p>

  <p class="indent">The thing inside was wrapped in white cloth, fine linen from the look of it.</p>

  <p class="indent">“An altar boy’s surplice,” Callahan said. Then, seeing Roland didn’t know the word: “A thing to wear.” He shrugged. “My heart said to wrap it up, and so I did.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Your heart surely said true,” Roland whispered. He was thinking of the bag Jake had brought out of the vacant lot, the one with <span class="smallcaps">NOTHING BUT STRIKES AT MID-WORLD LANES</span> on the side. They would need it, aye and aye, but he didn’t like to think of the transfer.</p>

  <p class="indent">Then he put thought aside—fear as well—and folded back the cloth. Beneath the surplice, wrapped in it, was a wooden box.</p>

  <p class="indent">Despite his fear, Roland reached out to touch that dark, heavy wood. <span class="txit">It will be like touching some lightly oiled metal,</span> he thought, and it was. He felt an erotic shiver shake itself deep inside him; it kissed his fear like an old lover and then was gone.</p>

  <p class="indent">“This is black ironwood,” Roland whispered. “I have heard of it but never seen it.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“In my <span class="txit">Tales of Arthur,</span> it’s called ghostwood,” Callahan whispered back.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aye? Is it so?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Certainly the box had a ghostly air to it, as of something derelict which had come to rest, however temporarily, after long wandering. The gunslinger very much would have liked to give it a second caress—the dark, dense wood begged his hand—but he had heard the vast hum of the thing <a id="page_411"></a>inside rise a notch before falling back to its former drone. <span class="txit">The wise man doesn’t poke a sleeping bear with a stick,</span> he told himself. It was true, but it didn’t change what he wanted. He did touch the wood once more, lightly, with just the tips of his fingers, then smelled them. There was an aroma of camphor and fire and—he would have sworn it—the flowers of the far north country, the ones that bloom in the snow.</p>

  <p class="indent">Three objects had been carved on top of the box: a rose, a stone, and a door. Beneath the door was this:</p>

  <p class="centera1"><img alt="images" class="calibre13" src="../Images/00030.jpeg" /></p>

  <p class="indent">Roland reached out again. Callahan made a move forward, as if to stop him, and then subsided. Roland touched the carving beneath the image of the door. Again the hum beneath it rose—the hum of the black ball hidden inside the box.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Un . . . ?” he whispered, and ran the ball of his thumb across the raised symbols again. “Un . . . found?” Not what he read but what his fingertips heard.</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes, I’m sure that’s what it says,” Callahan whispered back. He looked pleased, but still grasped Roland’s wrist and pushed it, wanting the gunslinger’s hand away from the box. A fine sweat had broken on his brow and forearms. “It makes sense, in a way. A leaf, a stone, an unfound door. They’re symbols in a book from my side. <span class="txit">Look Homeward, Angel,</span> it’s called.”</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">A leaf, a stone, a door,</span> Roland thought. <span class="txit">Only substitute</span> rose <span class="txit">for</span> leaf. <span class="txit">Yes. That feels right.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><a id="page_412"></a>“Will you take it?” Callahan asked. Only his voice rose slightly now, out of its whisper, and the gunslinger realized he was begging.</p>

  <p class="indent">“You’ve actually seen it, Pere, have you?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Aye. Once. It’s horrible beyond telling. Like the slick eye of a monster that grew outside God’s shadow. Will you take it, gunslinger?”</p>

  <p class="indent">“Yes.”</p>

  <p class="indent">“When?”</p>

  <p class="indent">Faintly, Roland heard the chime of bells—a sound so beautifully hideous it made you want to grind your teeth against it. For a moment the walls of Pere Callahan’s church wavered. It was as if the thing in the box had spoken to them: <span class="txit">Do you see how little it all matters? How quickly and easily I can take it all away, should I choose to do so? Beware, gunslinger! Beware, shaman! The abyss is all around you. You float or fall into it at my whim.</span></p>

  <p class="indent">Then the <span class="txit">kammen</span> were gone.</p>

  <p class="indent">“When?” Callahan reached over the box in its hole and grasped Roland’s shirt. <span class="txit">“When?”</span></p>

  <p class="indent">“Soon,” Roland said.</p>

  <p class="indent"><span class="txit">Too soon,</span> his heart replied.</p>
