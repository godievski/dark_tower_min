  <p class="para-flush">Panic is highly contagious, especially in situations when nothing is known and everything is in flux. It was the sight of Miguel, the old <i class="calibre">mozo,</i> that started Susan down its greased slope. He was in the middle of Seafront’s courtyard, clutching his broom of twigs against his chest and looking at the riders who passed to and fro with an expression of perplexed misery. His <i class="calibre">sombrero</i> was twisted around on his back, and Susan observed with something like horror that Miguel—usually brushed and clean and neat as a pin—was wearing his <i class="calibre">serape</i> inside out. There were tears on his cheeks, and as he turned this way and that, following the passing riders, trying to hile those he recognized, she thought of a child she had once seen toddle out in front of an oncoming stage. The child had been pulled back in time by his father; who would pull Miguel back?</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She started for him, and a <i class="calibre">vaquero</i> aboard a wild-eyed spotted roan galloped so close by her that one stirrup ticked off her hip and the horse’s tail flicked her forearm. She voiced a strange-sounding little chuckle. She had been worried about Miguel and had almost been run down herself! Funny!</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She looked both ways this time, started forward, then drew back again as a loaded wagon came careering around the corner, tottering on two wheels at first. What it was loaded with she couldn’t see—the goods in the wagonbed were covered with a tarp—but she saw Miguel move toward it, still clutching his broom. Susan thought of the child in front of the stage again and shrieked an inarticulate cry of alarm. Miguel cringed back at the last moment and the cart flew by him, <a id="page-515"></a>bounded and swayed across the courtyard, and disappeared out through the arch.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Miguel dropped his broom, clapped both hands to his cheeks, fell to his knees, and began to pray in a loud, lamenting voice. Susan watched him for a moment, her mouth working, and then sprinted for the stables, no longer taking care to keep against the side of the building. She had caught the disease that would grip almost all of Hambry by noon, and although she managed to do a fairly apt job of saddling Pylon (on any other day there would have been three stable-boys vying for the chance to help the pretty sai), any ability to think had left her by the time she heel-kicked the startled horse into a run outside the stable door.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">When she rode past Miguel, still on his knees and praying to the bright sky with his hands upraised, she saw him no more than any other rider had before her.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">2</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">She rode straight down the High Street, thumping her spurless heels at Pylon’s sides until the big horse was fairly flying. Thoughts, questions, possible plans of action . . . none of those had a place in her head as she rode. She was but vaguely aware of the people milling in the street, allowing Pylon to weave his own path through them. The only thing she was aware of was his name—<i class="calibre">Roland, Roland, Roland!</i>—ringing in her head like a scream. Everything had gone upside down. The brave little <i class="calibre">ka-tet</i> they had made that night at the graveyard was broken, three of its members jailed and with not long to live (if they even <i class="calibre">were</i> still alive), the last member lost and confused, as crazy with terror as a bird in a barn.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">If her panic had held, things might have turned out in a much different fashion. But as she rode through the center of town and out the other side, her way took her toward the house she had shared with her father and her aunt. That lady had been watching for the very rider who now approached.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As Susan neared, the door flew open and Cordelia, dressed in black from throat to toe, rushed down the front walk to the street, shrieking with either horror or laughter. Perhaps both. The sight of her cut through the foreground haze of panic in Susan’s mind . . . but not because she recognized her aunt.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“Rhea!”</i> she cried, and drew back on the reins so violently <a id="page-516"></a>that the horse skidded, reared, and almost tilted them over backward. That would likely have crushed the life out of his mistress, but Pylon managed to keep at least his back feet, pawing at the sky with his front ones and whinnying loudly. Susan slung an arm around his neck and hung on for dear life.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cordelia Delgado, wearing her best black dress and a lace mantilla over her hair, stood in front of the horse as if in her own parlor, taking no notice of the hooves cutting the air less than two feet in front of her nose. In one gloved hand she held a wooden box.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan belatedly realized that this wasn’t Rhea, but the mistake really wasn’t that odd. Aunt Cord wasn’t as thin as Rhea (not yet, anyway), and more neatly dressed (except for her dirty gloves—why her aunt was wearing gloves in the first place Susan didn’t know, let alone why they looked so smudged), but the mad look in her eyes was horribly similar.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Good day t’ye, Miss Oh So Young and Pretty!” Aunt Cord greeted her in a cracked, vivacious voice that made Susan’s heart tremble. Aunt Cord curtseyed one-handed, holding the little box curled against her chest with the other. “Where go ye on this fine autumn day? Where go ye so speedy? To no lover’s arms, that seems sure, for one’s dead and the other ta’en!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cordelia laughed again, thin lips drawing back from big white teeth. Horse teeth, almost. Her eyes glared in the sunlight.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Her mind’s broken,</i> Susan thought. <i class="calibre">Poor thing. Poor old thing.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Did thee put Dearborn up to it?” Aunt Cord asked. She crept to Pylon’s side and looked up at Susan with luminous, liquid eyes. “Thee did, didn’t thee? Aye! Perhaps thee even gave him the knife he used, after runnin yer lips o’er it for good luck. Ye’re in it together—why not admit it? At least admit thee’s lain with that boy, for I know it’s true. I saw the way he looked at ye the day ye were sitting in the window, and the way ye looked back at him!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan said, “If ye’ll have truth, I’ll give it to ye. We’re lovers. And we’ll be man and wife ere Year’s End.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cordelia raised one dirty glove to the blue sky and waved it as if saying hello to the gods. She screamed with mingled triumph and laughter as she waved. “And t’be <i class="calibre">wed,</i> she thinks! Ooooo! Ye’d no doubt drink the blood of your victims on the marriage altar, too, would ye not? Oh, wicked! It makes me <a id="page-517"></a>weep!” But instead of weeping she laughed again, a howl of mirth into the blind blue face of the sky.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We planned no murders,” Susan said, drawing—if only in her own mind—a line of difference between the killings at Mayor’s House and the trap they had hoped to spring on Farson’s soldiers. “And he <i class="calibre">did</i> no murders. No, this is the business of your friend Jonas, I wot. His plan, his filthy work.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cordelia plunged her hand into the box she held, and Susan understood at once why the gloves she wore were dirty: she had been grubbing in the stove.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“I curse thee with the ashes!”</i> Cordelia cried, flinging a black and gritty cloud of them at Susan’s leg and the hand which held Pylon’s reins. <i class="calibre">“I curse thee to darkness, both of thee! Be ye happy together, ye faithless! Ye murderers! Ye cozeners! Ye liars! Ye fornicators! Ye lost and renounced!”</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">With each cry, Cordelia Delgado threw another handful of ashes. And with each cry, Susan’s mind grew clearer, colder. She held fast and allowed her aunt to pelt her; in fact, when Pylon, feeling the gritty rain against his side, attempted to pull away, Susan gigged him set. There were spectators now, avidly watching this old ritual of renunciation (Sheemie was among them, eyes wide and mouth quivering), but Susan barely noticed. Her mind was her own again, she had an idea of what to do, and for that alone she supposed she owed her aunt some sort of thanks.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I forgive ye, Aunt,” she said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The box of stove-ashes, now almost empty, tumbled from Cordelia’s hands as if Susan had slapped her. “What?” she whispered. “What does thee say?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“For what ye did to yer brother and my father,” Susan said. “For what ye were a part of.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She rubbed a hand on her leg and bent with the hand held out before her. Before her aunt could pull away, Susan had wiped ashes down one of her cheeks. The smudge stood out there like a wide, dark scar. “But wear that, all the same,” she said. “Wash it off if ye like, but I think ye’ll wear it in yer heart yet awhile.” She paused. “I think ye already do. Goodbye.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Where does thee think thee’s going?” Aunt Cord was pawing at the soot-mark on her face with one gloved hand, and when she lunged forward in an attempt to grasp Pylon’s reins, she stumbled over the box and almost fell. It was Susan, still bent over to her aunt’s side, who grasped her shoulder and <a id="page-518"></a>held her up. Cordelia pulled back as if from the touch of an adder. “Not to him! Ye’ll not go to him now, ye mad goose!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan turned her horse away. “None of yer business, Aunt. This is the end between us. But mark what I say: we’ll be married by Year’s End. Our firstborn is already conceived.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Thee’ll be married tomorrow night if thee goes nigh him! Joined in smoke, wedded in fire, bedded in the ashes! <i class="calibre">Bedded in the ashes,</i> do ye hear me?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The madwoman advanced on her, railing, but Susan had no more time to listen. The day was fleeting. There would be time to do the things that needed doing, but only if she moved at speed.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Goodbye,” she said again, and then galloped away. Her aunt’s last words followed her: <i class="calibre">In the ashes, do ye hear me?</i></p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">3</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">On her way out of town along the Great Road, Susan saw riders coming toward her, and got off the highway. This would not, she felt, be a good time to meet pilgrims. There was an old granary nearby; she rode Pylon behind it, stroked his neck, murmured for him to be quiet.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">It took the riders longer to reach her position than she would have expected, and when they finally got there, she saw why. Rhea was with them, sitting in a black cart covered with magical symbols. The witch had been scary when Susan had seen her on the night of the Kissing Moon, but still recognizably human; what the girl saw passing before her now, rocking from side to side in the black cart and clutching a bag in her lap, was an unsexed, sore-raddled creature that looked more like a troll than a human being. With her were the Big Coffin Hunters.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“To Seafront!” the thing in the cart screamed. “Hie you on, and at full speed! I’ll sleep in Thorin’s bed tonight or know the reason why! Sleep in it and piss in it, if I take a notion! Hie you on, I say!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Depape—it was to his horse that the cart had been harnessed—turned around and looked at her with distaste and fear. “Still your mouth.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Her answer was a fresh burst of laughter. She rocked from side to side, holding a bag on her lap with one hand and pointing at Depape with the twisted, long-nailed index finger of <a id="page-519"></a>the other. Looking at her made Susan feel weak with terror, and she felt the panic around her again, like some dark fluid that would happily drown her brain if given half a chance.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She worked against the feeling as best she could, holding onto her mind, refusing to let it turn into what it had been before and would be again if she let it—a brainless bird trapped in a barn, bashing into the walls and ignoring the open window through which it had entered.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Even when the cart was gone below the next hill and there was nothing left of them but dust hanging in the air, she could hear Rhea’s wild cackling.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">4</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">She reached the hut in the Bad Grass at one o’ the clock. For a moment she just sat astride Pylon, looking at it. Had she and Roland been here hardly twenty-four hours ago? Making love and making plans? It was hard to believe, but when she dismounted and went in, the wicker basket in which she had brought them a cold meal confirmed it. It still sat upon the rickety table.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Looking at the hamper, she realized she hadn’t eaten since the previous evening—a miserable supper with Hart Thorin that she’d only picked at, too aware of his eyes on her body. Well, they’d done their last crawl, hadn’t they? And she’d never have to walk down another Seafront hallway wondering what door he was going to come bursting out of like Jack out of his box, all grabbing hands and stiff, randy prick.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Ashes,</i> she thought. <i class="calibre">Ashes and ashes. But not us, Roland. I swear, my darling, not us.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">She was frightened and tense, trying to put everything she now must do in order—a process to be followed just as there was a process to be followed when saddling a horse—but she was also sixteen and healthy. One look at the hamper and she was ravenous.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She opened it, saw there were ants on the two remaining cold beef sandwiches, brushed them off, and gobbled the sandwiches down. The bread had gotten rather stiff, but she hardly noticed. There was a half jar of sweet cider and part of a cake, as well.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">When she had finished everything, she went to the north corner of the hut and moved the hides someone had begun to <a id="page-520"></a>cure and then lost interest in. There was a hollow beneath. Within it, wrapped in soft leather, were Roland’s guns.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">If things go badly, thee must come here and take them west to Gilead. Find my father.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">With faint but genuine curiosity, Susan wondered if Roland had really expected she would ride blithely off to Gilead with his unborn child in her belly while he and his friends were roasted, screaming and red-handed, on the Reap-Night bonfire.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She pulled one of the guns out of its holster. It took her a moment or two to see how to get the revolver open, but then the cylinder rolled out and she saw that each chamber was loaded. She snapped it back into place and checked the other one.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She concealed them in the blanket-roll behind her saddle, just as Roland had, then mounted up and headed east again. But not toward town. Not yet. She had one more stop to make first.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">5</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">At around two o’ the clock, word that Fran Lengyll would be speaking at the Town Gathering Hall began to sweep through the town of Mejis. No one could have said where this news (it was too firm and specific to be a rumor) began, and no one much cared; they simply passed it on.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">By three o’ the clock, the Gathering Hall was full, and two hundred or more stood outside, listening as Lengyll’s brief address was relayed back to them in whispers. Coral Thorin, who had begun passing the news of Lengyll’s impending appearance at the Travellers’ Rest, was not there. She knew what Lengyll was going to say; had, in fact, supported Jonas’s argument that it should be as simple and direct as possible. There was no need for rabble-rousing; the townsfolk would be a mob by sundown of Reaping Day, a mob always picked its own leaders, and it always picked the right ones.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Lengyll spoke with his hat held in one hand and a silver reap-charm hanging from the front of his vest. He was brief, he was rough, and he was convincing. Most folks in the crowd had known him all their lives, and didn’t doubt a word he said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Hart Thorin and Kimba Rimer had been murdered by Dearborn, Heath, and Stockworth, Lengyll told the crowd of men <a id="page-521"></a>in denim and women in faded gingham. The crime had come home to them because of a certain item—a bird’s skull—left in Mayor Thorin’s lap.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Murmurs greeted this. Many of Lengyll’s listeners had seen the skull, either mounted on the horn of Cuthbert’s saddle or worn jauntily around his neck. They had laughed at his prankishness. Now they thought of how he had laughed back at them, and realized he must have been laughing at a different joke all along. Their faces darkened.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The weapon used to slit the Chancellor’s throat, Lengyll continued, had belonged to Dearborn. The three young men had been taken that morning as they prepared to flee Mejis. Their motivations were not entirely clear, but they were likely after horses. If so, they would be for John Farson, who was known to pay well for good nags, and in cash. They were, in other words, traitors to their own lands and to the cause of the Affiliation.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Lengyll had planted Brian Hookey’s son Rufus three rows back. Now, exactly on time, Rufus Hookey shouted out: “Has they confessed?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye,” Lengyll said. “Confessed both murders, and spoke it most proud, so they did.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">A louder murmur at this, almost a rumble. It ran backward like a wave to the outside, where it went from mouth to mouth: most proud, most proud, they had murdered in the dark of night and spoke it most proud.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Mouths were tucked down. Fists clenched.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Dearborn said that Jonas and his friends had caught on to what they were doing, and took the word to Rimer. They killed Chancellor Rimer to shut him up while they finished their chores, and Thorin in case Rimer had passed word on.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">This made little sense, Latigo had argued. Jonas had smiled and nodded. <i class="calibre">No,</i> he had said, <i class="calibre">not a mite of sense, but it doesn’t matter.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Lengyll was prepared to answer questions, but none were asked. There was only the murmur, the dark looks, the muted click and clink of reap-charms as people shifted on their feet.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The boys were in jail. Lengyll made no statement concerning what would happen to them next, and once again he was not asked. He said that some of the activities scheduled for the next day—the games, the rides, the turkey-run, the pumpkin-carving contest, the pig-scramble, the riddling competition, and <a id="page-522"></a>the dance—had been cancelled out of respect for the tragedy. The things that really mattered would go on, of course, as they always had and must: the cattle and livestock judging, the horse-pull, the sheep-shearing, the stockline meetings, and the auctions: horse, pig, cow, sheep. And the bonfire at moonrise. The bonfire and the burning of the guys. <i class="calibre">Charyou tree</i> was the end of Reaping Fair-Day, and had been since time out of mind. Nothing would stop it save the end of the world.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The bonfire will burn and the stuffy-guys will burn on it,” Eldred Jonas had told Lengyll. “That’s all you’re to say. It’s all you <i class="calibre">need</i> to say.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">And he’d been right, Lengyll saw. It was on every face. Not just the determination to do right, but a kind of dirty eagerness. There were old ways, old rites of which the red-handed stuffy-guys were one surviving remnant. There were <i class="calibre">los ceremoniosos</i>: <i class="calibre">Charyou tree.</i> It had been generations since they had been practiced (except, every once and again, in secret places out in the hills), but sometimes when the world moved on, it came back to where it had been.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Keep it brief,</i> Jonas had said, and it had been fine advice, fine advice indeed. He wasn’t a man Lengyll would have wanted around in more peaceful times, but a useful one in times such as these.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Gods give you peace,” he said now, stepping back and folding his arms with his hands on his shoulders to show he had finished. “Gods give us all peace.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Long days and peaceful nights,” they returned in a low, automatic chorus. And then they simply turned and left, to go wherever folks went on the afternoon before Reaping. For a good many of them, Lengyll knew, it would be the Travellers’ Rest or the Bayview Hotel. He raised a hand and mopped his brow. He hated to be out in front of people, and never so much as today, but he thought it had gone well. Very well, indeed.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">6</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The crowd streamed away without speaking. Most, as Lengyll had foreseen, headed for the saloons. Their way took them past the jail, but few looked at it . . . and those few who did did so in tiny, furtive glances. The porch was empty (save for a plump red-handed stuffy sprawled in Sheriff Avery’s <a id="page-523"></a>rocker), and the door stood ajar, as it usually did on warm and sunny afternoons. The boys were inside, no doubt about that, but there was no sign that they were being guarded with any particular zeal.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">If the men passing on their way downhill to the Rest and the Bayview had banded together into one group, they could have taken Roland and his friends with no trouble whatsoever. Instead, they went by with their heads down, walking stolidly and with no conversation to where the drinks were waiting. Today was not the day. Nor tonight.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Tomorrow, however—</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">7</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Not too far from the Bar K, Susan saw something on the Barony’s long slope of grazing-land that made her rein up and simply sit in the saddle with her mouth open. Below her and much farther east of her position, at least three miles away, a band of a dozen cowboys had rounded up the biggest herd of Drop-runners she had ever seen: perhaps four hundred head in all. They ran lazily, going where the <i class="calibre">vaqs</i> pointed them with no trouble.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Probably think they’re going in for the winter,</i> Susan thought.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">But they weren’t headed in toward the ranches running along the crest of the Drop; the herd, so large it flowed on the grass like a cloud-shadow, was headed west, toward Hanging Rock.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan had believed everything Roland said, but this made it true in a personal way, one she could relate directly to her dead father.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Horses, of courses.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You bastards,” she murmured. “You horse-thieving <i class="calibre">bastards</i>.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She turned Pylon and rode for the burned-out ranch. To her right, her shadow was growing long. Overhead, the Demon Moon glimmered ghostly in the daylight sky.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">8</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">She had worried that Jonas might have left men at the Bar K—although why he would’ve she didn’t really know, and the <a id="page-524"></a>fear turned out to be groundless in any case. The ranch was as empty as it had been for the five or six years between the fire that had put paid to it and the arrival of the boys from In-World. She could see signs of that morning’s confrontation, however, and when she went into the bunkhouse where the three of them had slept, she at once saw the gaping hole in the floorboards. Jonas had neglected to close it up again after taking Alain’s and Cuthbert’s guns.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She went down the aisle between the bunks, dropped to one knee, and looked into the hole. Nothing. Yet she doubted if what she had come for had been there in the first place—the hole wasn’t big enough.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She paused, looking at the three cots. Which was Roland’s? She supposed she could find out—her nose would tell her, she knew the smell of his hair and skin very well—but she thought she would do better to put such soft impulses behind her. What she needed now was to be hard and quick—to move without pausing or looking back.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Ashes,</i> Aunt Cord whispered in her head, almost too faintly to hear. Susan shook her head impatiently, as if to clear that voice away, and walked out back.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">There was nothing behind the bunkhouse, nothing behind the privy or to either side of it. She went around to the back of the old cook-shack next, and there she found what she’d come looking for, placed casually and with no attempt at concealment: the two small barrels she had last seen slung over Caprichoso’s back.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The thought of the mule summoned the thought of Sheemie, looking down at her from his man’s height and with his hopeful boy’s face. <i class="calibre">I’d like to take a</i> fin de año <i class="calibre">kiss from ye, so I would.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Sheemie, whose life had been saved by “Mr. Arthur Heath.” Sheemie, who had risked the wrath of the witch by giving Cuthbert the note meant for her aunt. Sheemie, who had brought these barrels up here. They had been smeared with soot to partially camouflage them, and Susan got some on her hands and the sleeves of her shirt as she took off the tops—more ashes. But the firecrackers were still inside: the round, fist-sized big-bangers and the smaller lady-fingers.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She took plenty of both, stuffing her pockets until they bulged and carrying more in her arms. She stowed them in her saddlebags, then looked up at the sky. Three-thirty. She wanted <a id="page-525"></a>to get back to Hambry no earlier than twilight, and that meant at least an hour to wait. There was a little time to be soft, after all.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan went back into the bunkhouse and found the bed which had been Roland’s easily enough. She knelt beside it like a child saying bedtime prayers, put her face against his pillow, and inhaled deeply.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Roland,” she said, her voice muffled. “How I love thee. How I love thee, dear.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She lay on his bed and looked toward the window, watching the light drain away. Once she raised her hands in front of her eyes, examining the barrel-soot on her fingers. She thought of going to the pump in front of the cookhouse and washing, but decided not to. Let it stay. They were <i class="calibre">ka-tet</i>, one from many—strong in purpose and strong in love.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Let the ashes stay, and do their worst.</p>

  <p class="para-flush">
   <i class="calibre">My Susie has ’er faults, but she’s always on time,</i> Pat Delgado used to say. <i class="calibre">Fearful punctual, that girl.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">It was true on the night before Reap. She skirted her own house and rode up to the Travellers’ Rest not ten minutes after the sun had finally gone behind the hills, filling the High Street with thick mauve shadows.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The street was eerily deserted, considering it was the night before Reap; the band which had played in Green Heart every night for the last week was silent; there were periodic rattles of firecrackers, but no yelling, laughing children; only a few of the many colored lamps had been lit.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Stuffy-guys seemed to peer from every shadow-thickened porch. Susan shivered at the sight of their blank white-cross eyes.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Doings at the Rest were similarly odd. The hitching-rails were crowded (even more horses had been tied at the rails of the mercantile across the street) and light shone from every window—so many windows and so many lights that the inn looked like a vast ship on a darkened sea—but there was none of the usual riot and jubilation, all set to the jagtime tunes pouring out of Sheb’s piano.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She found she could imagine the customers inside all too well—a hundred men, maybe more—simply standing around <a id="page-526"></a>and drinking. Not talking, not laughing, not chucking the dice down Satan’s Alley and cheering or groaning at the result. No bottoms stroked or pinched; no Reap-kisses stolen; no arguments started out of loose mouths and finished with hard fists. Just men drinking, not three hundred yards from where her love and his friends were locked up. The men who were here wouldn’t do anything tonight but drink, though. And if she was lucky . . . brave and lucky . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As she drew Pylon up in front of the saloon with a murmured word, a shape rose out of the shadows. She tensed, and then the first orangey light of the rising moon caught Sheemie’s face. She relaxed again—even laughed a little, mostly at herself. He was a part of their <i class="calibre">ka-tet;</i> she knew he was. Was it surprising that he should know, as well?</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Susan,” he murmured, taking off his <i class="calibre">sombrera</i> and holding it against his chest. “I been waiting for’ee.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Why?” she asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“ ’Cause I knew ye’d come.” He looked back over his shoulder at the Rest, a black bulk spraying crazy light toward every point of the compass. “We’re going to let Arthur and them free, ain’t we?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I hope so,” she said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We have to. The folks in there, they don’t talk, but they don’t <i class="calibre">have</i> to talk. I knows, Susan, daughter of Pat. <i class="calibre">I knows.</i>”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She supposed he did. “Is Coral inside?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Sheemie shook his head. “Gone up to Mayor’s House. She told Stanley she was going to help lay out the bodies for the funeral day after tomorrow, but I don’t think she’ll be here for the funeral. I think the Big Coffin Hunters is going and she’ll go with ’em.” He raised a hand and swiped at his leaking eyes.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Your mule, Sheemie—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All saddled, and I got the long halter.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She looked at him, open-mouthed. “How did ye know—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Same way I knew ye’d be coming, Susan-sai. I just knew.” He shrugged, then pointed vaguely. “Capi’s around the back. I tied him to the cook’s pump.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’s good.” She fumbled in the saddlebag where she had put the smaller firecrackers. “Here. Take some of these. Do’ee have a sulfur or two?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye.” He asked no questions, simply stuffed the firecrackers into his front pocket. She, however, who had never <a id="page-527"></a>been through the batwing doors of the Travellers’ Rest in her whole life, had another question for him.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What do they do with their coats and hats and <i class="calibre">serapes</i> when they come in, Sheemie? They must take em off; drinking’s warm work.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Oh, aye. They puts em on a long table just inside the door. Some fights about whose is whose when they’re ready to go home.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She nodded, thinking hard and fast. He stood before her, still holding his <i class="calibre">sombrera</i> against his chest, letting her do what he could not . . . at least not in the conventionally understood way. At last she raised her head again.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Sheemie, if you help me, you’re done in Hambry . . . done in Mejis . . . done in the Outer Arc. You go with us if we get away. You have to understand that. Do you?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She saw he did; his face fairly shone with the idea. “Aye, Susan! Go with you and Will Dearborn and Richard Stockworth and my best friend, Mr. Arthur Heath! Go to In-World! We’ll see buildings and statues and women in gowns like fairy princesses and—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“If we’re caught, we’ll be killed.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He stopped smiling, but his eyes didn’t waver. “Aye, killed we’ll be if ta’en, most like.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Will you still help me?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Capi’s all saddled,” he repeated. Susan reckoned that was answer enough. She took hold of the hand pressing the <i class="calibre">sombrera</i> to Sheemie’s chest (the hat’s crown was pretty well crushed, and not for the first time). She bent, holding Sheemie’s fingers with one hand and the horn of her saddle with the other, and kissed his cheek. He smiled up at her.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We’ll do our best, won’t we?” she asked him.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye, Susan daughter of Pat. We’ll do our best for our friends. Our very best.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes. Now listen, Sheemie. Very carefully.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She began to talk, and Sheemie listened.</p>

  <p class="para-flush">Twenty minutes later, as the bloated orange moon struggled above the buildings of the town like a pregnant woman climbing a steep hill, a lone <i class="calibre">vaquero</i> led a mule along Hill Street in the direction of the Sheriff’s office. This end of Hill Street <a id="page-528"></a>was a pit of shadows. There was a little light around Green Heart, but even the park (which would have been thronged, noisy, and brilliantly lit in any other year) was mostly empty. Nearly all the booths were closed, and of those few that remained open, only the fortune-teller was doing any business. Tonight all fortunes were bad, but still they came—don’t they always?</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The <i class="calibre">vaquero</i> was wearing a heavy serape; if this particular cowboy had the breasts of a woman, they were concealed. The <i class="calibre">vaq</i> wore a large, sweat-stained <i class="calibre">sombrero;</i> if this cowboy had the face of a woman, it was likewise concealed. Low, from beneath that hat’s broad brim, came a voice singing “Careless Love.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The mule’s small saddle was buried under the large bundle which had been roped to it—cloth or clothes of some kind, it might have been, although the deepening shadows made it impossible to say for sure. Most amusing of all was what hung around the mule’s neck like some peculiar reap-charm: two <i class="calibre">sombreros</i> and a drover’s hat strung on a length of rope.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As the <i class="calibre">vaq</i> neared the Sheriff’s office, the singing ceased. The place might have been deserted if not for the single dim light shining through one window. In the porch rocker was a comical stuffy-guy wearing one of Herk Avery’s embroidered vests and a tin star. There were no guards; absolutely no sign that the three most hated men in Mejis were sequestered within. And now, very faintly, the <i class="calibre">vaquero</i> could hear the strum of a guitar.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">It was blotted out by a thin rattle of firecrackers. The <i class="calibre">vaq</i> looked over one shoulder and saw a dim figure. It waved. The <i class="calibre">vaquero</i> nodded, waved back, then tied the mule to the hitching-post—the same one where Roland and his friends had tied their horses when they had come to introduce themselves to the Sheriff, on a summer day so long ago.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">

  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The door opened—no one had bothered to lock it—while Dave Hollis was trying, for about the two hundredth time, to play the bridge of “Captain Mills, You Bastard.” Across from him, Sheriff Avery sat rocked back in his desk chair with his hands laced together on his paunch. The room flickered with mild orange lamplight.</p>
  <a id="page-529">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“You keep it up, Deputy Dave, and there won’t have to be any execution,” Cuthbert Allgood said. He was standing at the door of one of the cells with his hands wrapped around the bars. “We’ll kill ourselves. In self-defense.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Shut up, maggot,” Sheriff Avery said. He was half-dozing in the wake of a four-chop dinner, thinking of how he would tell his brother (and his brother’s wife, who was killing pretty) in the next Barony about this heroic day. He would be modest, but he would still get it across to them that he’d played a central role; that if not for him, these three young <i class="calibre">ladrones</i> might have—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Just don’t sing,” Cuthbert said to Dave. “I’ll confess to the murder of Arthur Eld himself if you just don’t sing.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">To Bert’s left, Alain was sitting cross-legged on his bunk. Roland was lying on his with his hands behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. But at the moment the door’s latch clicked, he swung to a sitting position. As if he’d only been waiting.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’ll be Bridger,” Deputy Dave said, gladly putting his guitar aside. He hated this duty and couldn’t wait to be relieved. Heath’s jokes were the worst. That he could continue to joke in the face of what was going to happen to them tomorrow.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I think it’s likely one of <i class="calibre">them,</i>” Sheriff Avery said, meaning the Big Coffin Hunters.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">In fact, it was neither. It was a cowboy all but buried in a <i class="calibre">serape</i> that looked much too big for him (the ends actually dragged on the boards as he clumped in and shut the door behind him), and wearing a hat that came way down over his eyes. To Herk Avery, the fellow looked like somebody’s idea of a cowboy stuffy.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Say, stranger!” he said, beginning to smile . . . for this was surely someone’s joke, and Herk Avery could take a joke as well as any man. Especially after four chops and a mountain of mashed. “Howdy! What business do ye—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The hand which hadn’t closed the door had been under the <i class="calibre">serape.</i> When it came out, it was clumsily holding a gun all three of the prisoners recognized at once. Avery stared at it, his smile slowly fading. His hands unlaced themselves. His feet, which had been propped up on his desk, came down to the floor.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Whoa, partner,” he said slowly. “Let’s talk about it.”</p>
  <a id="page-530">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“Get the keys off the wall and unlock the cells,” the <i class="calibre">vaq</i> said in a hoarse, artificially deep voice. Outside, unnoticed by all save Roland, more firecrackers rattled in a dry, popping string.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I can’t hardly do that,” Avery said, easing open the bottom drawer of his desk with his foot. There were several guns, left over from that morning, inside. “Now, I don’t know if that thing’s loaded, but I don’t hardly think a traildog like you—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The newcomer pointed the gun at the desk and pulled the trigger. The report was deafening in the little room, but Roland thought—hoped—that with the door shut, it would sound like just another firecracker. Bigger than some, smaller than others.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Good girl,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre">Oh, good girl—but be careful. For gods’ sake, Sue, be careful.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">All three of them standing in a line at the cell doors now, eyes wide and mouths tight.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The bullet struck the corner of the Sheriff’s rolltop and tore off a huge splinter. Avery screamed, tilted back in his chair again, and went sprawling. His foot remained hooked under the drawer-pull; the drawer shot out and overturned, spilling three ancient firearms across the board floor.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Susan, look out!” Cuthbert shouted, and then: “No, Dave!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">At the end of his life, it was duty and not fear of the Big Coffin Hunters which propelled Dave Hollis, who had hoped to be Sheriff of Mejis himself when Avery retired (and, he sometimes told his wife, Judy, a better one than Fatso had ever dreamed of being). He forgot that he had serious questions about the way the boys had been taken as well as about what they might or might not have done. All he thought of then was that they were prisoners o’ the Barony, and such would not be taken if he could help it.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He lunged for the cowboy in the too-big clothes, meaning to tear the gun out of his hands. And shoot him with it, if necessary.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">12</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Susan was staring at the yellow blaze of fresh wood on the corner of the Sheriff’s desk, forgetting everything in her <a id="page-531"></a>amazement—so much damage inflicted by the single twitch of a finger!—when Cuthbert’s desperate shout awakened her to her position.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She shrank back against the wall, avoiding Dave’s first swipe at the oversized <i class="calibre">serape,</i> and, without thinking, pulled the trigger again. There was another loud explosion, and Dave Hollis—a young man only two years older than she herself—was flung backward with a smoking hole in his shirt between two points of the star he wore. His eyes were wide and unbelieving. His monocle lay by one outstretched hand on its length of black silk ribbon. One of his feet struck his guitar and knocked it to the floor with a thrum nearly as musical as the chords he had been trying to make.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Dave,” she whispered. “Oh Dave, I’m sorry, what did I do?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Dave tried once to get up, then collapsed forward on his face. The hole going into the front of him was small, but the one she was looking at now, the one coming out the back, was huge and hideous, all black and red and charred edges of cloth . . . as if she had run him through with a blazing hot poker instead of shooting him with a gun, which was supposed to be merciful and civilized and was clearly neither one.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Dave,” she whispered. “Dave, I . . .”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“Susan look out!”</i> Roland shouted.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">It was Avery. He scuttled forward on his hands and knees, seized her around the calves, and yanked her feet out from under her. She came down on her bottom with a tooth-rattling crash and was face to face with him—his frog-eyed, large-pored face, his garlic-smelling hole of a mouth.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Gods, ye’re a <i class="calibre">girl,</i>” he whispered, and reached for her. She pulled the trigger of Roland’s gun again, setting the front of her <i class="calibre">serape</i> on fire and blowing a hole in the ceiling. Plaster dust drifted down. Avery’s ham-sized hands settled around her throat, cutting off her wind. Somewhere far away, Roland shrieked her name.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She had one more chance.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Maybe.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">One’s enough, Sue,</i> her father spoke inside of her head. <i class="calibre">One’s all ye need, my dear.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">She cocked Roland’s pistol with the side of her thumb, <a id="page-532"></a>socked the muzzle deep into the flab hanging from the underside of Sheriff Herk Avery’s head, and pulled the trigger.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The mess was considerable.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">13</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Avery’s head dropped into her lap, as heavy and wet as a raw roast. Above it, she could feel growing heat. At the bottom edge of her vision was the yellow flicker of fire.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“On the desk!” Roland shouted, yanking the door of his cell so hard it rattled in its frame. “Susan, the water-pitcher! For your father’s sake!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She rolled Avery’s head out of her lap, got to her feet, and staggered to the desk with the front of the <i class="calibre">serape</i> burning. She could smell its charred stench and was grateful in some far corner of her mind that she’d had time, while waiting for dusk, to tie her hair behind her.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The pitcher was almost full, but not with water; she could smell the sweet-sour tang of <i class="calibre">graf.</i> She doused herself with it, and there was a brisk hissing as the liquid hit the flames. She stripped the <i class="calibre">serape</i> off (the oversized <i class="calibre">sombrero</i> came with it) and threw it on the floor. She looked at Dave again, a boy she had grown up with, one she might even have kissed behind the door of Hookey’s, once upon an antique time.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Susan!” It was Roland’s voice, harsh and urgent. “The keys! Hurry!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan grabbed the keyring from the nail on the wall. She went to Roland’s cell first and thrust the ring blindly through the bars. The air was thick with smells of gunsmoke, burned wool, blood. Her stomach clenched helplessly at every breath.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland picked the right key, reached back through the bars with it, and plunged it into the lockbox. A moment later he was out, and hugging her roughly as her tears broke. A moment after that, Cuthbert and Alain were out, as well.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You’re an angel!” Alain said, hugging her himself.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Not I,” she said, and began to cry harder. She thrust the gun at Roland. It felt filthy in her hand; she never wanted to touch one again. “Him and me played together when we were berries. He was one of the good ones—never a braid-puller or a bully—and he grew up a good one. Now I’ve ended him, and who’ll tell his wife?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland took her back into his arms and held her there for a <a id="page-533"></a>moment. “You did what you had to. If not him, then us. Does thee not know it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She nodded against his chest. “Avery, him I don’t mind so much, but Dave . . .”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Come on,” Roland said. “Someone might recognize the gunshots for what they were. Was it Sheemie throwing firecrackers?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She nodded. “I’ve got clothes for you. Hats and <i class="calibre">serapes.</i>”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan hurried back to the door, opened it, peeked out in either direction, then slipped into the growing dark.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cuthbert took the charred <i class="calibre">serape</i> and put it over Deputy Dave’s face. “Tough luck, partner,” he said. “You got caught in between, didn’t you? I reckon you wasn’t so bad.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan came back in, burdened with the stolen gear which had been tied to Capi’s saddle. Sheemie was already off on his next errand without having to be told. If the inn-boy was a halfwit, she’d known a lot of folks in her time who were running on quarters and eighths.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Where’d you get this stuff?” Alain asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The Travellers’ Rest. And <i class="calibre">I</i> didn’t. Sheemie did.” She held the hats out. “Come on, hurry.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cuthbert took the headgear and passed it out. Roland and Alain had already slipped into the <i class="calibre">serapes;</i> with the hats added and pulled well down over their faces, they could have been any Drop-<i class="calibre">vaqs</i> in Barony.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Where are we going?” Alain asked as they stepped out onto the porch. The street was still dark and deserted at this end; the gunshots had attracted no attention.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Hookey’s, to start with,” Susan said. “That’s where your horses are.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They went down the street together in a little group of four. Capi was gone; Sheemie had taken the mule along. Susan’s heart was thudding rapidly and she could feel sweat standing out on her brow, but she still felt cold. Whether or no what she had done was murder, she had ended two lives this evening, and crossed a line that could never be recrossed in the other direction. She had done it for Roland, for her love, and simply knowing she could have done no different now offered some consolation.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Be happy together, ye faithless, ye cozeners, ye murderers. I curse thee with the ashes.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan seized Roland’s hand, and when he squeezed, she <a id="page-534"></a>squeezed back. And as she looked up at Demon Moon, its wicked face now draining from choleric red-orange to silver, she thought that when she had pulled the trigger on poor, earnest Dave Hollis, she had paid for her love with the dearest currency of all—had paid with her soul. If he left her now, her aunt’s curse would be fulfilled, for only ashes would remain.</p>
