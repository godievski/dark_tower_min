  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Jake didn’t know how easy or difficult Blaine might find the last ten puzzlers in <i class="calibre">Riddle-De-Dum!,</i> but they looked pretty tough to him. Of course, he reminded himself, he wasn’t a thinking-machine with a citywide bank of computers to draw on. All he could do was go for it; God hates a coward, as Eddie sometimes said. If the last ten failed, he would try Aaron Deepneau’s Samson riddle (<i class="calibre">Out of the eater came forth meat,</i> and so on). If that one also failed, he’d probably . . . shit, he didn’t know <i class="calibre">what</i> he’d do, or even how he’d feel. <i class="calibre">The truth is,</i> Jake thought, <i class="calibre">I’m fried.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">And why not? He had gone through an extraordinary swarm of emotions in the last eight hours or so. First, terror: of being sure he and Oy were going to drop off the suspension bridge and to their deaths in the River Send; of being driven through the crazed maze that was Lud by Gasher; of having to look into the Tick-Tock Man’s terrible green eyes and try to answer his unanswerable questions about time, Nazis, and the nature of transitive circuits. Being questioned by Tick-Tock had been like having to take a final exam in hell.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Then the exhilaration of being rescued by Roland (and Oy; without Oy he would almost certainly be toast now), the wonder of all they had seen beneath the city, his awe at the way Susannah had solved Blaine’s gate-riddle, and the final mad rush to get aboard the mono before Blaine could release the stocks of nerve-gas stored under Lud.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">After surviving all that, a kind of blissed-out surety had settled over him—of <i class="calibre">course</i> Roland would stump Blaine, who <a id="page-30"></a>would then keep his part of the bargain and set them down safe and sound at his final stop (whatever passed for Topeka in this world). Then they would find the Dark Tower and do whatever they were supposed to do there, right what needed righting, fix what needed fixing. And then? They Lived Happily Ever After, of course. Like folk in a fairy tale.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Except . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They shared each other’s thoughts, Roland had said; sharing <i class="calibre">khef</i> was part of what <i class="calibre">ka-tet</i> meant. And what had been seeping into Jake’s thoughts ever since Roland stepped into the aisle and began to try Blaine with riddles from his young days was a sense of doom. It wasn’t coming just from the gunslinger; Susannah was sending out the same grim blue-black vibe. Only Eddie wasn’t sending it, and that was because he’d gone off somewhere, was chasing his own thoughts. That might be good, but there were no guarantees, and—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">—and Jake began to be scared again. Worse, he felt desperate, like a creature that is pressed deeper and deeper into its final corner by a relentless foe. His fingers worked restlessly in Oy’s fur, and when he looked down at them, he realized an amazing thing: the hand which Oy had bitten into to keep from falling off the bridge no longer hurt. He could see the holes the bumbler’s teeth had made, and blood was still crusted in his palm and on his wrist, but the hand itself no longer hurt. He flexed it cautiously. There was some pain, but it was low and distant, hardly there at all.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Blaine, what may go up a chimney down but cannot go down a chimney up?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“A LADY’S PARASOL,” Blaine replied in that tone of jolly complacency which Jake, too, was coming to loathe.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Thankee-sai, Blaine, once again you have answered true. Next—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Roland?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger looked around at Jake, and his look of concentration lightened a bit. It wasn’t a smile, but it went a little way in that direction, at least, and Jake was glad.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What is it, Jake?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“My hand. It was hurting like crazy, and now it’s stopped!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“SHUCKS,” Blaine said in the drawling voice of John Wayne. “I COULDN’T WATCH A HOUND SUFFER WITH A MASHED-UP FOREPAW LIKE THAT, LET ALONE A <a id="page-31"></a>FINE LITTLE TRAILHAND LIKE YOURSELF. SO I FIXED IT UP.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“How?” Jake asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“LOOK ON THE ARM OF YOUR SEAT.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake did, and saw a faint gridwork of lines. It looked a little like the speaker of the transistor radio he’d had when he was seven or eight.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“ANOTHER BENEFIT OF TRAVELLING BARONY CLASS,” Blaine went on in his smug voice. It crossed Jake’s mind that Blaine would fit in perfectly at the Piper School. The world’s first slo-trans, dipolar nerd. “THE HAND-SCAN SPECTRUM MAGNIFIER IS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL ALSO CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING MINOR FIRST AID, SUCH AS I HAVE PERFORMED ON YOU. IT IS ALSO A NUTRIENT DELIVERY SYSTEM, A BRAIN-PATTERN RECORDING DEVICE, A STRESS-ANALYZER, AND AN EMOTION-ENHANCER WHICH CAN NATURALLY STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF ENDORPHINS. HAND-SCAN IS ALSO CAPABLE OF CREATING VERY BELIEVABLE ILLUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS. WOULD YOU CARE TO HAVE YOUR FIRST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WITH A NOTED SEX-GODDESS FROM YOUR LEVEL OF THE TOWER, JAKE OF NEW YORK? PERHAPS MARILYN MONROE, RAQUEL WELCH, OR EDITH BUNKER?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake laughed. He guessed that laughing at Blaine might be risky, but this time he just couldn’t help it. “There <i class="calibre">is</i> no Edith Bunker,” he said. “She’s just a character on a TV show. The actress’s name is, um, Jean Stapleton. Also, she looks like Mrs. Shaw. She’s our housekeeper. Nice, but not—you know—a babe.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">A long silence from Blaine. When the voice of the computer returned, a certain coldness had replaced the jocose ain’t-we-having-fun tone of voice.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I CRY YOUR PARDON, JAKE OF NEW YORK. I ALSO WITHDRAW MY OFFER OF A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">That’ll teach me,</i> Jake thought, raising one hand to cover a smile. Aloud (and in what he hoped was a suitably humble tone of voice) he said: “That’s okay, Blaine. I think I’m still a little young for that, anyway.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah and Roland were looking at each other. Susannah didn’t know who Edith Bunker was—<i class="calibre">All in the Family</i> hadn’t <a id="page-32"></a>been on the tube in her when. But she grasped the essence of the situation just the same; Jake saw her full lips form one soundless word and send it to the gunslinger like a message in a soapbubble:</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Mistake</i>.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Yes. Blaine had made a mistake. More, Jake Chambers, a boy of eleven, had picked up on it. And if Blaine had made one, he could make another. Maybe there was hope after all. Jake decided he would treat that possibility as he had treated the <i class="calibre">graf</i> of River Crossing and allow himself just a little.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">2</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Roland nodded imperceptibly at Susannah, then turned back to the front of the coach, presumably to resume riddling. Before he could open his mouth, Jake felt his body pushed forward. It was funny; you couldn’t feel a thing when the mono was running flat-out, but the minute it began to decelerate, you knew.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“HERE IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY OUGHT TO SEE,” Blaine said. He sounded cheerful again, but Jake didn’t trust that tone; he had sometimes heard his father start telephone conversations that way (usually with some subordinate who had FUB, Fucked Up Big), and by the end Elmer Chambers would be up on his feet, bent over the desk like a man with a stomach cramp and screaming at the top of his lungs, his cheeks red as radishes and the circles of flesh under his eyes as purple as an eggplant. “I HAVE TO STOP HERE, ANYWAY, AS I MUST SWITCH TO BATTERY POWER AT THIS POINT AND THAT MEANS PRE-CHARGING.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The mono stopped with a barely perceptible jerk. The walls around them once more drained of color and then became transparent. Susannah gasped with fear and wonder. Roland moved to his left, felt for the side of the coach so he wouldn’t bump his head, then leaned forward with his hands on his knees and his eyes narrowed. Oy began to bark again. Only Eddie seemed unmoved by the breathtaking view which had been provided them by the Barony Coach’s visual mode. He glanced around once, face preoccupied and somehow bleary with thought, and then looked down at his hands again. Jake glanced at him with brief curiosity, then stared back out.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They were halfway across a vast chasm and seemed to be hovering on the moon-dusted air. Beyond them Jake could <a id="page-33"></a>see a wide, boiling river. Not the Send, unless the rivers in Roland’s world were somehow able to run in different directions at different points in their courses (and Jake didn’t know enough about Mid-World to entirely discount that possibility); also, this river was not placid but raging, a torrent that came tumbling out of the mountains like something that was pissed off and wanted to brawl.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">For a moment Jake looked at the trees which dressed the steep slopes along the sides of this river, registering with relief that they looked pretty much all right—the sort of firs you’d expect to see in the mountains of Colorado or Wyoming, say—and then his eyes were dragged back to the lip of the chasm. Here the torrent broke apart and dropped in a waterfall so wide and so deep that Jake thought it made Niagara, where he had gone with his parents (one of three family vacations he could remember; two had been cut short by urgent calls from his father’s Network), look like the kind you might see in a third-rate theme-park. The air filling the enclosing semicircle of the falls was further thickened by an uprushing mist that looked like steam; in it half a dozen moonbows gleamed like gaudy, interlocking dream-jewelry. To Jake they looked like the overlapping rings which symbolized the Olympics.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jutting from the center of the falls, perhaps two hundred feet below the point where the river actually went over the drop, were two enormous stone protrusions. Although Jake had no idea how a sculptor (or a team of them) could have gotten down to where they were, he found it all but impossible to believe they had simply eroded that way. They looked like the heads of enormous, snarling dogs.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">The Falls of the Hounds,</i> he thought. There was one more stop beyond this—Dasherville—and then Topeka. Last stop. Everybody out.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“ONE MOMENT,” Blaine said. “I MUST ADJUST THE VOLUME FOR YOU TO ENJOY THE FULL EFFECT.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">There was a brief, whispery hooting sound—a kind of mechanical throat-clearing—and then they were assaulted by a vast roar. It was water—a billion gallons a minute, for all Jake knew—pouring over the lip of the chasm and falling perhaps two thousand feet into the deep stone basin at the base of the falls. Streamers of mist floated past the blunt almost-faces of the jutting dogs like steam from the vents of hell. The level of sound kept climbing. Now Jake’s whole head vibrated with <a id="page-34"></a>it, and as he clapped his hands over his ears, he saw Roland, Eddie, and Susannah doing the same. Oy was barking, but Jake couldn’t hear him. Susannah’s lips were moving again, and again he could read the words—<i class="calibre">Stop it, Blaine, stop it!</i>—but he couldn’t hear them any more than he could hear Oy’s barks, although he was sure Susannah was screaming at the top of her lungs.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">And still Blaine increased the sound of the waterfall, until Jake could feel his eyes shaking in their sockets and he was sure his ears were going to short out like overstressed stereo speakers.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Then it was over. They still hung above the moon-misty drop, the moonbows still made their slow and dreamlike revolutions before the curtain of endlessly falling water, the wet and brutal stone faces of the dog-guardians continued to jut out of the torrent, but that world-ending thunder was gone.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">For a moment Jake thought what he’d feared had happened, that he had gone deaf. Then he realized that he could hear Oy, still barking, and Susannah crying. At first these sounds seemed distant and flat, as if his ears had been packed with cracker-crumbs, but then they began to clarify.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie put his arm around Susannah’s shoulders and looked toward the route-map. “Nice guy, Blaine.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I MERELY THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENJOY HEARING THE SOUND OF THE FALLS AT FULL VOLUME,” Blaine said. His booming voice sounded laughing and injured at the same time. “I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP YOU TO FORGET MY REGRETTABLE MISTAKE IN THE MATTER OF EDITH BUNKER.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">My fault,</i> Jake thought. <i class="calibre">Blaine may just be a machine, and a suicidal one at that, but he still doesn’t like to be laughed at.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">He sat beside Susannah and put his own arm around her. He could still hear the Falls of the Hounds, but the sound was now distant.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What happens here?” Roland asked. “How do you charge your batteries?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“YOU WILL SEE SHORTLY, GUNSLINGER. IN THE MEANTIME, TRY ME WITH A RIDDLE.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right, Blaine. Here’s one of Cort’s own making, and has posed many in its time.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I AWAIT IT WITH GREAT INTEREST.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland, pausing perhaps to gather his thoughts, looked up <a id="page-35"></a>at the place where the roof of the coach had been and where there was now only a starry spill across a black sky (Jake could pick out Aton and Lydia—Old Star and Old Mother—and was oddly comforted by the sight of them, still glaring at each other from their accustomed places). Then the gunslinger looked back at the lighted rectangle which served them as Blaine’s face.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“ ‘We are very little creatures; all of us have different features. One of us in glass is set; one of us you’ll find in jet. Another you may see in tin, and a fourth is boxed within. If the fifth you should pursue, it can never fly from you. What are we?’ ”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“A AND E AND I AND O AND U,” Blaine replied. “THE VOWELS OF THE HIGH SPEECH.” Still no hesitation, not so much as a whit. Only that voice, mocking and just about two steps from laughter; the voice of a cruel little boy watching bugs run around on top of a hot stove. “ALTHOUGH THAT PARTICULAR RIDDLE IS NOT FROM YOUR TEACHER, ROLAND OF GILEAD; I KNOW IT FROM JONATHAN SWIFT OF LONDON—A CITY IN THE WORLD YOUR FRIENDS COME FROM.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Thankee-sai,” Roland said, and his sai sounded like a sigh. “Your answer is true, Blaine, and undoubtedly what you believe of the riddle’s origins is true as well. That Cort knew of other worlds is something I long suspected. I think he may have held palaver with the <i class="calibre">manni</i> who lived outside the city.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I CARE NOT ABOUT THE <i class="calibre">MANNI,</i> ROLAND OF GILEAD. THEY WERE ALWAYS A FOOLISH SECT. TRY ME WITH ANOTHER RIDDLE.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right. What has—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“HOLD, HOLD. THE FORCE OF THE BEAM GATHERS. LOOK NOT DIRECTLY AT THE HOUNDS, MY INTERESTING NEW FRIENDS! AND SHIELD YOUR EYES!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake looked away from the colossal rock sculptures jutting from the falls, but didn’t get his hand up quite in time. With his peripheral vision he saw those featureless heads suddenly develop eyes of a fiercely glowing blue. Jagged tines of lightning leaped out of them and toward the mono. Then Jake was lying on the carpeted floor of the Barony Coach with the heels of his hands pasted against his closed eyes and the sound of Oy whining in one faintly ringing ear. Beyond Oy, he heard the crackle of electricity as it stormed around the mono.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">When Jake opened his eyes again, the Falls of the Hounds <a id="page-36"></a>were gone; Blaine had opaqued the cabin. He could still hear the sound, though—a waterfall of electricity, a force somehow drawn from the Beam and shot out through the eyes of the stone heads. Blaine was feeding himself with it, somehow. <i class="calibre">When we go on,</i> Jake thought, <i class="calibre">he’ll be running on batteries. Then Lud really will be behind us. For good.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Blaine,” Roland said. “How is the power of the Beam stored in that place? What makes it come from the eyes of yon stone temple-dogs? How do you use it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Silence from Blaine.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“And who carved them?” Eddie asked. “Was it the Great Old Ones? It wasn’t, was it? There were people even before them. Or . . . <i class="calibre">were</i> they people?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">More silence from Blaine. And maybe that was good. Jake wasn’t sure how much he wanted to know about the Falls of the Hounds, or what went on beneath them. He had been in the dark of Roland’s world before, and had seen enough to believe that most of what was growing there was neither good nor safe.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Better not to ask him,” the voice of Little Blaine drifted down from over their heads. “Safer.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Don’t ask him silly questions, he won’t play silly games,” Eddie said. That distant, dreaming look had come onto his face again, and when Susannah spoke his name, he didn’t seem to hear.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">3</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Roland sat down across from Jake and scrubbed his right hand slowly up the stubble on his right cheek, an unconscious gesture he seemed to make only when he was feeling tired or doubtful. “I’m running out of riddles,” he said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake looked back at him, startled. The gunslinger had posed fifty or more to the computer, and Jake supposed that was a lot to just yank out of your head with no preparation, but when you considered that riddling had been such a big deal in the place where Roland had grown up . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He seemed to read some of this on Jake’s face, for a small smile, lemon-bitter, touched the corners of his mouth, and he nodded as if the boy had spoken out loud. “I don’t understand, either. If you’d asked me yesterday or the day before, I would have told you that I had at least a thousand riddles <a id="page-37"></a>stored up in the junkbin I keep at the back of my mind. Perhaps two thousand. But . . .”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He lifted one shoulder in a shrug, shook his head, rubbed his hand up his cheek again.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’s not like forgetting. It’s as if they were never there in the first place. What’s happening to the rest of the world is happening to me, I reckon.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You’re moving on,” Susannah said, and looked at Roland with an expression of pity which Roland could look back at for only a second or two; it was as if he felt burned by her regard. “Like everything else here.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes, I fear so.” He looked at Jake, lips tight, eyes sharp. “Will you be ready with the riddles from your book when I call on you?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Good. And take heart. We’re not finished yet.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Outside, the dim crackle of electricity ceased.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I HAVE FED MY BATTERIES AND ALL IS WELL,” Blaine announced.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Marvelous,” Susannah said dryly.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Luss!” Oy agreed, catching Susannah’s sarcastic tone exactly.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I HAVE A NUMBER OF SWITCHING FUNCTIONS TO PERFORM. THESE WILL TAKE ABOUT FORTY MINUTES AND ARE LARGELY AUTOMATIC. WHILE THIS SWITCHOVER TAKES PLACE AND THE ACCOMPANYING CHECKLIST IS RUNNING, WE SHALL CONTINUE OUR CONTEST. I AM ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’s like when you have to switch over from electric to diesel on the train to Boston,” Eddie said. He still sounded as if he wasn’t quite with them. “At Hartford or New Haven or one of those other places where no one in their right fucking mind would want to live.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Eddie?” Susannah asked. “What are you—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland touched her shoulder and shook his head.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“NEVER MIND EDDIE OF NEW YORK,” Blaine said in his expansive, gosh-but-this-is-fun voice.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’s right,” Eddie said. “Never mind Eddie of New York.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“HE KNOWS NO GOOD RIDDLES. BUT YOU KNOW MANY, ROLAND OF GILEAD. TRY ME WITH ANOTHER.”</p>
  <a id="page-38">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">And, as Roland did just that, Jake thought of his Final Essay. <i class="calibre">Blaine is a pain,</i> he had written there. <i class="calibre">Blaine is a pain and that is the truth.</i> It was the truth, all right.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The <i class="calibre">stone</i> truth.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">A little less than an hour later, Blaine the Mono began to move again.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">4</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Susannah watched with dreadful fascination as the flashing dot approached Dasherville, passed it, and made its final dogleg for home. The dot’s movement said that Blaine was moving a bit more slowly now that it had switched over to batteries, and she fancied the lights in the Barony Coach were a little dimmer, but she didn’t believe it would make much difference, in the end. Blaine might reach his terminus in Topeka doing six hundred miles an hour instead of eight hundred, but his last load of passengers would be toothpaste either way.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland was also slowing down, going deeper and deeper into that mental junkbin of his to find riddles. Yet he <i class="calibre">did</i> find them, and he refused to give up. As always. Ever since he had begun teaching her to shoot, Susannah had felt a reluctant love for Roland of Gilead, a feeling that seemed a mixture of admiration, fear, and pity. She thought she would never really like him (and that the Detta Walker part of her might always hate him for the way he had seized hold of her and dragged her, raving, into the sun), but her love was nonetheless strong. He had, after all, saved Eddie Dean’s life and soul; had rescued her beloved. She must love him for that if for nothing else. But she loved him even more, she suspected, for the way he would never, <i class="calibre">never</i> give up. The word <i class="calibre">retreat</i> didn’t seem to be in his vocabulary, even when he was discouraged . . . as he so clearly was now.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Blaine, where may you find roads without carts, forests without trees, cities without houses?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“ON A MAP.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You say true, sai. Next. I have a hundred legs but cannot stand, a long neck but no head; I eat the maid’s life. What am I?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“A BROOM, GUNSLINGER. ANOTHER VARIATION ENDS, ‘I <i class="calibre">EASE</i> THE MAID’S LIFE.’ I LIKE YOURS BETTER.”</p>
  <a id="page-39">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland ignored this. “Cannot be seen, cannot be felt, cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. It lies behind the stars and beneath the hills. Ends life and kills laughter. What is it, Blaine?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“THE DARK.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Thankee-sai, you speak true.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The diminished right hand slid up the right cheek—the old fretful gesture—and the minute scratching sound produced by the callused pads of his fingers made Susannah shiver. Jake sat cross-legged on the floor, looking at the gunslinger with a kind of fierce intensity.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“This thing runs but cannot walk, sometimes sings but never talks. Lacks arms, has hands; lacks a head but has a face. What is it, Blaine?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“A CLOCK.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Shit,” Jake whispered, lips compressing.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah looked over at Eddie and felt a passing ripple of irritation. He seemed to have lost interest in the whole thing—had “zoned out,” in his weird 1980s slang. She thought to throw an elbow into his side, wake him up a little, then remembered Roland shaking his head at her and didn’t. You wouldn’t know he was thinking, not from that slack expression on his face, but maybe he was.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">If so, you better hurry it up a little, precious,</i> she thought. The dot on the route-map was still closer to Dasherville than Topeka, but it would reach the halfway point within the next fifteen minutes or so.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">And still the match went on, Roland serving questions, Blaine sending the answers whistling right back at him, low over the net and out of reach.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">What builds up castles, tears down mountains, makes some blind, helps others to see? SAND.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Thankee-sai.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">What lives in winter, dies in summer, and grows with its roots upward? AN ICICLE.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Blaine, you say true.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">Man walks over; man walks under; in time of war he burns asunder? A BRIDGE.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Thankee-sai.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">A seemingly endless parade of riddles marched past her, one after the other, until she lost all sense of their fun and playfulness. Had it been so in the days of Roland’s youth, she wondered, during the riddle contests of Wide Earth and Full <a id="page-40"></a>Earth, when he and his friends (although she had an idea they hadn’t <i class="calibre">all</i> been his friends, no, not by a long chalk) had vied for the Fair-Day goose? She guessed that the answer was probably yes. The winner had probably been the one who could stay fresh longest, keep his poor bludgeoned brains aerated somehow.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The killer was the way Blaine came back with the answer so damned <i class="calibre">promptly</i> each time. No matter how hard the riddle might seem to her, Blaine served it right back to their side of the court, <i class="calibre">ka-slam.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Blaine, what has eyes yet cannot see?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“THERE ARE FOUR ANSWERS,” Blaine replied. “NEEDLES, STORMS, POTATOES, AND A TRUE LOVER.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Thankee-sai, Blaine, you speak—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“LISTEN, ROLAND OF GILEAD. LISTEN, <i class="calibre">KA-TET</i>.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland fell silent at once, his eyes narrowing, his head slightly cocked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“YOU WILL SHORTLY HEAR MY ENGINES BEGIN TO CYCLE UP,” Blaine said. “WE ARE NOW EXACTLY SIXTY MINUTES OUT OF TOPEKA. AT THIS POINT—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“If we’ve been riding for seven hours or more, I grew up with the Brady Bunch,” Jake said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah looked around apprehensively, expecting some new terror or small act of cruelty in response to Jake’s sarcasm, but Blaine only chuckled. When he spoke again, the voice of Humphrey Bogart had resurfaced.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“TIME’S DIFFERENT HERE, SHWEETHEART. YOU MUST KNOW THAT BY NOW. BUT DON’T WORRY; THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS APPLY AS TIME GOES BY. WOULD I LIE TO YOU?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes,” Jake muttered.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">That apparently struck Blaine’s funnybone, because he began to laugh again—the mad, mechanical laughter that made Susannah think of funhouses in sleazy amusement parks and roadside carnivals. When the lights began to pulse in sync with the laughter, she shut her eyes and put her hands over her ears.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Stop it, Blaine! Stop it!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“BEG PARDON, MA’AM,” drawled the aw-shucks voice of Jimmy Stewart. “AH’M RIGHT SORRY IF I RUINT YOUR EARS WITH MY RISABILITY.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Ruin this,” Jake said, and hoisted his middle finger at the route-map.</p>

  <p class="para-indent">Susannah expected Eddie to laugh—you could count on him to be amused by vulgarity at any time of the day or night, she would have said—but Eddie only continued looking down at his lap, his forehead creased, his eyes vacant, his mouth hung slightly agape. He looked a little too much like the village idiot for comfort, Susannah thought, and again had to restrain herself from throwing an elbow into his side to get that doltish look off his face. She wouldn’t restrain herself for much longer; if they were going to die at the end of Blaine’s run, she wanted Eddie’s arms around her when it happened, Eddie’s eyes on her, Eddie’s mind with hers.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">But for now, better let him be.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“AT THIS POINT,” Blaine resumed in his normal voice, “I INTEND TO BEGIN WHAT I LIKE TO THINK OF AS MY KAMIKAZE RUN. THIS WILL QUICKLY DRAIN MY BATTERIES, BUT I THINK THE TIME FOR CONSERVATION HAS PASSED, DON’T YOU? WHEN I STRIKE THE TRANSTEEL PIERS AT THE END OF THE TRACK, I SHOULD BE TRAVELLING AT BETTER THAN NINE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR—FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN WHEELS, THAT IS. SEE YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR, AFTER AWHILE, CROCODILE, DON’T FORGET TO WRITE. I TELL YOU THIS IN THE SPIRIT OF FAIR PLAY, MY INTERESTING NEW FRIENDS. IF YOU HAVE BEEN SAVING YOUR BEST RIDDLES FOR LAST, YOU MIGHT DO WELL TO POSE THEM TO ME NOW.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The unmistakable greed in Blaine’s voice—its naked desire to hear and solve their best riddles before it killed them—made Susannah feel tired and old.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I might not have time even so to pose you all my <i class="calibre">very</i> best ones,” Roland said in a casual, considering tone of voice. “That would be a shame, wouldn’t it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">A pause ensued—brief, but more of a hesitation than the computer had accorded any of Roland’s riddles—and then Blaine chuckled. Susannah hated the sound of its mad laughter, but there was a cynical weariness in this chuckle that chilled her even more deeply. Perhaps because it was almost sane.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“GOOD, GUNSLINGER. A VALIANT EFFORT. BUT YOU ARE NOT SCHEHERAZADE, NOR DO WE HAVE A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS IN WHICH TO HOLD PALAVER.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I don’t understand you. I know not this Scheherazade.”</p>
  <a id="page-42">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“NO MATTER. SUSANNAH CAN FILL YOU IN, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW. PERHAPS EVEN EDDIE. THE POINT, ROLAND, IS THAT I’LL NOT BE DRAWN ON BY THE PROMISE OF MORE RIDDLES. WE VIE FOR THE GOOSE. COME TOPEKA, IT SHALL BE AWARDED, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Once more the diminished hand went up Roland’s cheek; once more Susannah heard the minute rasp of his fingers against the wiry stubble of his beard.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We play for keeps. No one cries off.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“CORRECT. NO ONE CRIES OFF.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right, Blaine, we play for keeps and no one cries off. Here’s the next.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“AS ALWAYS, I AWAIT IT WITH PLEASURE.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland looked down at Jake. “Be ready with yours, Jake; I’m almost at the end of mine.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake nodded.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Beneath them, the mono’s slo-trans engines continued to cycle up—that beat-beat-beat which Susannah did not so much hear as feel in the hinges of her jaw, the hollows of her temples, the pulse-points of her wrists.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">It’s not going to happen unless there’s a stumper in Jake’s book,</i> she thought. <i class="calibre">Roland can’t pose Blaine, and I think he knows it. I think he knew it an hour ago.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Blaine, I occur once in a minute, twice in every moment, but not once in a hundred thousand years. What am I?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">And so the contest would continue, Susannah realized, Roland asking and Blaine answering with his increasingly terrible lack of hesitation, like an all-seeing, all-knowing god. Susannah sat with her cold hands clasped in her lap and watched the glowing dot draw nigh Topeka, the place where all rail service ended, the place where the path of their <i class="calibre">ka-tet</i> would end in the clearing. She thought about the Hounds of the Falls, how they had jutted from the thundering white billows below the dark and starshot sky; she thought of their eyes.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Their electric-blue eyes.</p>
