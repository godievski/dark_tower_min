  <p class="para-flush">Roland walked to the end of the platform, kicking bits of pink metal out of his way as he went. At the stairs, he paused and looked back at them somberly. “More dead. Be ready.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They’re not . . . um . . . runny, are they?” Jake asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland frowned, then his face cleared as he understood what Jake meant. “No. Not runny. Dry.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’s all right, then,” Jake said, but he held his hand out to Susannah, who was being carried by Eddie for the time being. She gave him a smile and folded her fingers around his.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">At the foot of the stairs leading down to the commuter parking lot at the side of the station, half a dozen corpses lay together like a collapsed cornshock. Two were women, three were men. The sixth was a child in a stroller. A summer spent dead in the sun and rain and heat (not to mention at the mercy of any stray cats, coons, or woodchucks that might be passing) had given the toddler a look of ancient wisdom and mystery, like a child mummy discovered in an Incan pyramid. Jake supposed from the faded blue outfit it was wearing that it had been a boy, but it was impossible to tell for sure. Eyeless, lipless, its skin faded to dusky gray, it made a joke of gender—why did the dead baby cross the road? Because it was stapled to the superflu.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Even so, the toddler seemed to have voyaged through Topeka’s empty post-plague months better than the adults around it. They were little more than skeletons with hair. In a scrawny bunch of skin-wrapped bones that had once been fingers, one of the men clutched the handle of a suitcase that <a id="page-84"></a>looked like the Samsonites Jake’s parents owned. As with the baby (as with <i class="calibre">all</i> of them), his eyes were gone; huge dark sockets stared at Jake. Below them, a ring of discolored teeth jutted in a pugnacious grin. <i class="calibre">What took you so long, kid?</i> the dead man who was still clutching his suitcase seemed to be asking. <i class="calibre">Been waiting for you, and it’s been a long hot summer!</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Where were you guys hoping to go?</i> Jake wondered. <i class="calibre">Just where in the crispy crap did you think might be safe enough? Des Moines? Sioux City? Fargo? The moon?</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">They went down the stairs, Roland first, the others behind him, Jake still holding Susannah’s hand with Oy at his heels. The long-bodied bumbler seemed to descend each step in two stages, like a double trailer taking speed-bumps.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Slow down, Roland,” Eddie said. “I want to check the crip spaces before we go on. We might get lucky.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Crip spaces?” Susannah said. “What’re those?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake shrugged. He didn’t know. Neither did Roland.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah switched her attention to Eddie. “I only ask, sugarpie, because it sounds a little <i class="calibre">on</i>-pleasant. You know, like calling Negroes ‘blacks’ or gay folks ‘fruits.’ I know I’m just a poor ignorant pickaninny from the dark ages of 1964, but—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“There.” Eddie pointed at a rank of signs marking the parking-row closest to the station. There were actually two signs to a post, the top of each pair blue and white, the bottom red and white. When they drew a little closer, Jake saw the one on top was a wheelchair symbol. The one on the bottom was a warning: $200 <span class="smallcap">FINE FOR IMPROPER USE OF HANDICAPPED PARKING SPACE. STRICTLY ENFORCED BY TOPEKA P.D.</span></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“See there!” Susannah said triumphantly. “They shoulda done that a long time ago! Why, back in my when, you’re lucky if you can get your damn wheelchair through the doors of anything smaller than the Shop ’n Save. Hell, lucky if you can get it up over the curbs! And special parking? Forget it, sugar!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The lot was jammed almost to capacity, but even with the end of the world at hand, only two cars that didn’t have little wheelchair symbols on their license plates were parked in the row Eddie had called “the crip spaces.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake guessed that respecting the “crip spaces” was just one of those things that got a mysterious lifelong hold on people, <a id="page-85"></a>like putting zip-codes on letters, parting your hair, or brushing your teeth before breakfast.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“And there it is!” Eddie cried. “Hold your cards, folks, but I think we have a Bingo!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Still carrying Susannah on his hip—a thing he would have been incapable of doing for any extended period of time even a month ago—Eddie hurried over to a boat of a Lincoln. Strapped on the roof was a complicated-looking racing bicycle; poking out of the half-open trunk was a wheelchair. Nor was this the only one; scanning the row of “crip spaces,” Jake saw at least four more wheelchairs, most strapped to roof-racks, some stuffed into the backs of vans or station wagons, one (it looked ancient and fearsomely bulky) thrown into the bed of a pickup truck.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie set Susannah down and bent to examine the rig holding the chair in the trunk. There were a lot of crisscrossing elastic cords, plus some sort of locking bar. Eddie drew the Ruger Jake had taken from his father’s desk drawer. “Fire in the hole,” he said cheerfully, and before any of them could even think of covering their ears, he pulled the trigger and blew the lock off the security-bar. The sound went rolling into the silence, then echoed back. The warbling sound of the thinny returned with it, as if the gunshot had snapped it awake. <i class="calibre">Sounds Hawaiian, doesn’t it?</i> Jake thought, and grimaced with distaste. Half an hour ago, he wouldn’t have believed that a sound could be as physically upsetting, as . . . well, the smell of rotting meat, say, but he believed it now. He looked up at the turnpike signs. From this angle he could see only their tops, but that was enough to confirm that they were shimmering again. <i class="calibre">It throws some kind of field,</i> Jake thought. <i class="calibre">The way mixers and vacuum cleaners make static on the radio or TV, or the way that cyclotron gadget made the hair on my arms stand up when Mr. Kingery brought it to class and then asked for volunteers to come up and stand next to it.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie wrenched the locking bar aside, and used Roland’s knife to cut the elastic cords. Then he drew the wheelchair out of the trunk, examined it, unfolded it, and engaged the support which ran across the back at seat-level. <i class="calibre">“Voila!”</i> he said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah had propped herself on one hand—Jake thought she looked a little like the woman in this Andrew Wyeth painting he liked, <i class="calibre">Christina’s World</i>—and was examining the chair with some wonder.</p>
  <a id="page-86">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“God almighty, it looks so little ’n light!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Modern technology at its finest, darlin,” Eddie said. “It’s what we fought Vietnam for. Hop in.” He bent to help her. She didn’t resist him, but her face was set and frowning as he lowered her into the seat. Like she expected the chair to collapse under her, Jake thought. As she ran her hands over the arms of her new ride, her face gradually relaxed.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake wandered off a little, walking down another row of cars, running his fingers over their hoods, leaving trails of dust. Oy padded after him, pausing once to lift his leg and squirt a tire, as if he had been doing it all his life.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Make you homesick, honey?” Susannah asked from behind Jake. “Probably thought you’d never see an honest-to-God American automobile again, am I right?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake considered this and decided she was <i class="calibre">not</i> right. It had never crossed his mind that he would remain in Roland’s world forever; that he might never see another car. He didn’t think that would bother him, actually, but he also didn’t think it was in the cards. Not yet, anyway. There was a certain vacant lot in the New York when he had come from. It was on the corner of Second Avenue and Forty-sixth Street. Once there had been a deli there—Tom and Gerry’s, Party Platters Our Specialty—but now it was just rubble, and weeds, and broken glass, and . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">. . . and a rose. Just a single wild rose growing in a vacant lot where a bunch of condos were scheduled to go up at some point, but Jake had an idea that there was nothing quite like it growing anywhere else on Earth. Maybe not on any of those other worlds Roland had mentioned, either. There were roses as one approached the Dark Tower; roses by the billion, according to Eddie, great bloody acres of them. He had seen them in a dream. Still, Jake suspected that his rose was different even from those . . . and that until its fate was decided, one way or the other, he was not done with the world of cars and TVs and policemen who wanted to know if you had any identification and what your parents’ names were.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">And speaking of parents, I may not be done with them, either,</i> Jake thought. The idea hurried his heartbeat with a mixture of hope and alarm.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They stopped halfway down the row of cars, Jake staring blankly across a wide street (Gage Boulevard, he assumed) as <a id="page-87"></a>he considered these things. Now Roland and Eddie caught up to them.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“This baby’s gonna be great after a couple of months pushing the Iron Maiden,” Eddie said with a grin. “Bet you could damn near <i class="calibre">puff</i> it along.” He blew a deep breath at the back of the wheelchair to demonstrate. Jake thought of telling Eddie that there were probably others back there in the “crip spaces” with motors in them, then realized what Eddie must have known right away: their batteries would be dead.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah ignored him for the time being; it was Jake she was interested in. “You didn’t answer me, sug. All these cars get you homesick?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Nah. But I was curious about whether or not they were all cars I knew. I thought maybe . . . if this version of 1986 grew out of some other world than my 1977, there’d be a way to tell. But I <i class="calibre">can’t</i> tell. Because things change so darn fast. Even in nine years . . .” He shrugged, then looked at Eddie. “<i class="calibre">You</i> might be able to, though. I mean, you actually <i class="calibre">lived</i> in 1986.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie grunted. “I lived through it, but I didn’t exactly <i class="calibre">observe</i> it. I was fucked to the sky most of the time. Still . . . I suppose . . .”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie started pushing Susannah along the smooth macadam of the parking lot again, pointing to cars as they passed them. “Ford Explorer . . . Chevrolet Caprice . . . and that one there’s an old Pontiac, you can tell because of the split grille—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Pontiac Bonneville,” Jake said. He was amused and a little touched by the wonder in Susannah’s eyes—most of these cars must look as futuristic to her as Buck Rogers scout-ships. That made him wonder how Roland felt about them, and Jake looked around.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger showed no interest in the cars at all. He was gazing across the street, into the park, toward the turnpike . . . except Jake didn’t think he was actually looking at any of those things. Jake had an idea that Roland was simply looking into his own thoughts. If so, the expression on his face suggested that he wasn’t finding anything good there.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’s one of those little Chrysler K’s,” Eddie said, pointing, “and that’s a Subaru. Mercedes SEL 450, excellent, the car of champions . . . Mustang . . . Chrysler Imperial, good shape but must be older’n God—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Watch it, boy,” Susannah said, with a touch of what Jake <a id="page-88"></a>thought was real asperity in her voice. “I recognize that one. Looks new to me.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Sorry, Suze. Really. This one’s a Cougar . . . another Chevy . . . and one more . . . Topeka loves General Motors, big fuckin surprise there . . . Honda Civic . . . VW Rabbit . . . a Dodge . . . a Ford . . . a—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie stopped, looking at a little car near the end of the row, white with red trim. “A Takuro,” he said, mostly to himself. He went around to look at the trunk. “A Takuro <i class="calibre">Spirit,</i> to be exact. Ever hear of that make and model, Jake of New York?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake shook his head.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Me, neither,” he said. “Me fucking neither.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie began pushing Susannah toward Gage Boulevard (Roland with them but still mostly off in his own private world, walking when they walked, stopping where they stopped). Just shy of the lot’s automated entrance (<span class="smallcap">STOP TAKE TICKET</span>), Eddie halted.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“At this rate, we’ll be old before we get to yonder park and dead before we raise the turnpike,” Susannah said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">This time Eddie didn’t apologize, didn’t seem even to hear her. He was looking at the bumper sticker on the front of a rusty old AMC Pacer. The sticker was blue and white, like the little wheelchair signs marking the “crip spaces.” Jake squatted for a better look, and when Oy dropped his head on Jake’s knee, the boy stroked him absently. With his other hand he reached out and touched the sticker, as if to verify its reality. <span class="smallcap">KANSAS CITY MONARCHS</span>, it said. The O in Monarchs was a baseball with speedlines drawn out behind it, as if it were leaving the park.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie said: “Check me if I’m wrong on this, sport, because I know almost zilch about baseball west of Yankee Stadium, but shouldn’t that say Kansas City <i class="calibre">Royals</i>? You know, George Brett and all that?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake nodded. He knew the Royals, and he knew Brett, although he had been a young player in Jake’s when and must have been a fairly old one in Eddie’s.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Kansas City <i class="calibre">Athletics,</i> you mean,” Susannah said, sounding bewildered. Roland ignored it all; he was still cruising in his own personal ozone layer.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Not by ’86, darlin,” Eddie said kindly. “By ’86 the <a id="page-89"></a>Athletics were in Oakland.” He glanced from the bumper sticker to Jake. “Minor-league team, maybe?” he asked. “Triple A?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The Triple A Royals are still the Royals,” Jake said. “They play in Omaha. Come on, let’s go.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">And although he didn’t know about the others, Jake himself went on with a lighter heart. Maybe it was stupid, but he was relieved. He didn’t believe that this terrible plague was waiting up ahead for his world, because there were no Kansas City Monarchs in his world. Maybe that wasn’t enough information upon which to base a conclusion, but it felt true. And it was an enormous relief to be able to believe that his mother and father weren’t slated to die of a germ people called Captain Trips and be burned in a . . . a landfill, or something.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Except that wasn’t quite a sure thing, even if this wasn’t the 1986 version of his 1977 world. Because even if this awful plague had happened in a world where there were cars called Takuro Spirits and George Brett played for the K.C. Monarchs, Roland said the trouble was spreading . . . that things like the superflu were eating through the fabric of existence like battery acid eating its way into a piece of cloth.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger had spoken of time’s pool, a phrase which had at first struck Jake as romantic and charming. But suppose the pool was growing stagnant and swampy? And suppose these Bermuda Triangle–type things Roland called thinnies, once great rarities, were becoming the rule rather than the exception? Suppose—oh, and here was a hideous thought, one guaranteed to keep you lying awake until way past three—all of reality was sagging as the structural weaknesses of the Dark Tower grew? Suppose there came a crash, one level falling down into the next . . . and the next . . . and the next . . . until—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">When Eddie grasped his shoulder and squeezed, Jake had to bite his tongue to keep from screaming.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You’re giving yourself the hoodoos,” Eddie said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What do you know about it?” Jake asked. That sounded rude, but he was mad. From being scared or being seen into? He didn’t know. Didn’t much care, either.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“When it comes to the hoodoos, I’m an old hand,” Eddie said. “I don’t know exactly what’s on your mind, but whatever it is, this would be an <i class="calibre">excellent</i> time to stop thinking about it.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">That, Jake decided, was probably good advice. They walked <a id="page-90"></a>across the street together. Toward Gage Park and one of the greatest shocks of Jake’s life.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">2</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Passing under the wrought-iron arch with <span class="smallcap">GAGE PARK</span> written on it in old-fashioned, curlicued letters, they found themselves on a brick path leading through a garden that was half English Formal and half Ecuadoran Jungle. With no one to tend it through the hot Midwestern summer, it had run to riot; with no one to tend it this fall, it had run to seed. A sign just inside the arch proclaimed this to be the Reinisch Rose Garden, and there were roses, all right; roses everywhere. Most had gone over, but some of the wild ones still throve, making Jake think of the rose in the vacant lot at Forty-sixth and Second with a longing so deep it was an ache.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Off to one side as they entered the park was a beautiful old-time carousel, its prancing steeds and racing stallions now still on their posts. The carousel’s very silence, its flashing lights and steamy calliope music stilled forever, gave Jake a chill. Hung over the neck of one horse, dangling from a rawhide strip, was some kid’s baseball glove. Jake was barely able to look at it.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Beyond the carousel, the foliage grew even thicker, strangling the path until the travellers edged along single-file, like lost children in a fairy-tale wood. Thorns from overgrown and unpruned rosebushes tore at Jake’s clothes. He had somehow gotten into the lead (probably because Roland was still deep inside his own thoughts), and that was why he saw Charlie the Choo-Choo first.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">His only thought while approaching the narrow-gauge train-tracks which crossed the path—they were little more than toy tracks, really—was of the gunslinger saying that <i class="calibre">ka</i> was like a wheel, always rolling around to the same place again. <i class="calibre">We’re haunted by roses and trains,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre">Why? I don’t know. I guess it’s just another rid—</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Then he looked to his left, and “OhgoodnesstoChrist” fell out of his mouth, all in one word. The strength ran out of his legs and he sat down. His voice sounded watery and distant to his own ears. He didn’t quite faint, but the color drained out of the world until the running-to-riot foliage on the west side of the park looked almost as gray as the autumn sky overhead.</p>
  <a id="page-91">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“Jake! Jake, what’s wrong!” It was Eddie, and Jake could hear the genuine concern in his voice, but it seemed to be coming over a bad long-distance connection. From Beirut, say, or maybe Uranus. And he could feel Roland’s steadying hand on his shoulder, but it was as distant as Eddie’s voice.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Jake!” Susannah. “What’s wrong, honey? What—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Then she saw, and stopped talking at him. Eddie saw, and also stopped talking at him. Roland’s hand fell away. They all stood looking . . . except for Jake, who <i class="calibre">sat</i> looking. He supposed that strength and feeling would come back into his legs eventually and he would get up, but right now they felt like limp macaroni.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The train was parked fifty feet up, by a toy station that mimicked the one across the street. Hanging from its eaves was a sign which read <span class="smallcap">TOPEKA</span>. The train was Charlie the Choo-Choo, cowcatcher and all; a 402 Big Boy Steam Locomotive. And, Jake knew, if he found enough strength to get up on his feet and go over there, he would find a family of mice nested in the seat where the engineer (whose name had undoubtedly been Bob Something-or-other) had once sat. There would be another family, this one of swallows, nested in the smokestack.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">And the dark, oily tears,</i> Jake thought, looking at the tiny train waiting in front of its tiny station with his skin crawling all over his body and his balls hard and his stomach in a knot. <i class="calibre">At night it cries those dark, oily tears, and they’re rusting the hell out of his fine Stratham headlight. But in your time, Charlie-boy, you pulled your share of kids, right? Around and around Gage Park you went, and the kids laughed, except some of them weren’t</i> really <i class="calibre">laughing; some of them, the ones who were wise to you, were screaming. The way I’d scream now, if I had the strength.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">But his strength was coming back, and when Eddie put a hand under one of his arms and Roland put one under the other, Jake was able to get up. He staggered once, then stood steady.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Just for the record, I don’t blame you,” Eddie said. His voice was grim; so was his face. “I feel a little like falling over myself. That’s the one in your book; that’s it to the life.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“So now we know where Miss Beryl Evans got the idea for <i class="calibre">Charlie the Choo-Choo,</i>” Susannah said. “Either she lived <a id="page-92"></a>here, or sometime before 1942, when the damned thing was published, she visited Topeka—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“—and saw the kids’ train that goes through Reinisch Rose Garden and around Gage Park,” Jake said. He was getting over his scare now, and he—not just an only child but for most of his life a lonely child—felt a burst of love and gratitude for his friends. They had seen what he had seen, they had understood the source of his fright. Of course—they were <i class="calibre">ka-tet</i>.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It won’t answer silly questions, it won’t play silly games,” Roland said musingly. “Can you go on, Jake?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You sure?” Eddie asked, and when Jake nodded, Eddie pushed Susannah across the tracks. Roland went next. Jake paused a moment, remembering a dream he’d had—he and Oy had been at a train-crossing, and the bumbler had suddenly leaped onto the tracks, barking wildly at the oncoming headlight.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Now Jake bent and scooped Oy up. He looked at the rusting train standing silently in its station, its dark headlamp like a dead eye. “I’m not afraid,” he said in a low voice. “Not afraid of you.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The headlamp came to life and flashed at him once, brief but glare-bright, emphatic: <i class="calibre">I know different; I know different, my dear little squint.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Then it went out.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">None of the others had seen. Jake glanced once more at the train, expecting the light to flash again—maybe expecting the cursed thing to actually start up and make a run at him—but nothing happened.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Heart thumping hard in his chest, Jake hurried after his companions.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">3</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The Topeka Zoo (the <i class="calibre">World Famous</i> Topeka Zoo, according to the signs) was full of empty cages and dead animals. Some of the animals that had been freed were gone, but others had died near to hand. The big apes were still in the area marked Gorilla Habitat, and they appeared to have died hand-in-hand. That made Eddie feel like crying, somehow. Since the last of <a id="page-93"></a>the heroin had washed out of his system, his emotions always seemed on the verge of blowing up into a cyclone. His old pals would have laughed.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Beyond Gorilla Habitat, a gray wolf lay dead on the path. Oy approached it carefully, sniffed, then stretched out his long neck and began to howl.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Make him quit that, Jake, you hear me?” Eddie said gruffly. He suddenly realized he could smell decaying animals. The aroma was faint, mostly boiled off over the hot days of the summer just passed, but what was left made him feel like upchucking. Not that he could precisely remember the last time he’d eaten.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Oy! To me!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Oy howled one final time, then returned to Jake. He stood on the kid’s feet, looking up at him with those spooky wedding-ring eyes of his. Jake picked him up, took him in a circle around the wolf, and then set him down again on the brick path.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The path led them to a steep set of steps (weeds had begun to push through the stonework already), and at the top Roland looked back over the zoo and the gardens. From here they could easily see the circuit the toy train-tracks made, allowing Charlie’s riders to tour the entire perimeter of Gage Park. Beyond it, fallen leaves clattered down Gage Boulevard before a rush of cold wind.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“So fell Lord Perth,” murmured Roland.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“And the countryside did shake with that thunder,” Jake finished.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland looked down at him with surprise, like a man awakening from a deep sleep, then smiled and put an arm around Jake’s shoulders. “I have played Lord Perth in my time,” he said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Have you?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes. Very soon now you shall hear.”</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">4</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Beyond the steps was an aviary full of dead exotic birds; beyond the aviary was a snackbar advertising (perhaps heartlessly, given the location) <span class="smallcap">TOPEKA</span>’<span class="smallcap">S BEST BUFFALOBURGER</span>; beyond the snackbar was another wrought iron arch with a sign reading <span class="smallcap">COME BACK TO GAGE PARK REAL SOON</span>! Beyond <a id="page-94"></a>this was the curving upslope of a limited-access-highway entrance ramp. Above it, the green signs they had first spotted from across the way stood clear.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Turnpikin’ again,” Eddie said in a voice almost too low to hear. “Goddam.” Then he sighed.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What’s turnpikin’, Eddie?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake didn’t think Eddie was going to answer; when Susannah craned around to look at him as he stood with his fingers wrapped around the handles of the new wheelchair, Eddie looked away. Then he looked back, first at Susannah, then at Jake. “It’s not pretty. Not much about my life before Gary Cooper here yanked me across the Great Divide was.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You don’t have to—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’s also no big deal. A bunch of us would get together—me, my brother Henry, Bum O’Hara, usually, ’cause he had a car, Sandra Corbitt, and maybe this friend of Henry’s we called Jimmie Polio—and we’d stick all our names in a hat. The one we drew out was the . . . the trip-guide, Henry used to call him. He—she, if it was Sandi—had to stay straight. Relatively, anyway. Everyone else got seriously goobered. Then we’d all pile into Bum’s Chrysler and go up I-95 into Connecticut or maybe take the Taconic Parkway into upstate New York . . . only we called it the Catatonic Parkway. Listen to Creedence or Marvin Gaye or maybe even <i class="calibre">Elvis’s Greatest Hits</i> on the tape-player.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It was better at night, best when the moon was full. We’d cruise for hours sometimes with our heads stuck out the windows like dogs do when they’re riding, looking up at the moon and watching for shooting stars. We called it turnpikin’.” Eddie smiled. It looked like an effort. “A charming life, folks.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It sounds sort of fun,” Jake said. “Not the drug part, I mean, but riding around with your pals at night, looking at the moon and listening to the music . . . that sounds excellent.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It was, actually,” Eddie said. “Even stuffed so full of reds we were as apt to pee on our own shoes as in the bushes, it was excellent.” He paused. “That’s the horrible part, don’t you get it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Turnpikin’,” the gunslinger said. “Let’s do some.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They left Gage Park and crossed the road to the entrance ramp.</p>

  <p class="para-indent">“Do you know what any of that truck means, Roland?” Susannah asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland shook his head, but he looked troubled, and that introspective look never left his own eyes.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They went on.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">6</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">At the place where the ramp merged with the turnpike, the two men, the boy, and the bumbler clustered around Susannah in her new wheelchair. All of them looked east.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie didn’t know what the traffic situation would be like once they cleared Topeka, but here all the lanes, those headed west as well as the eastbound ones on their side, were crammed with cars and trucks. Most of the vehicles were piled high with possessions gone rusty with a season’s worth of rain.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">But the traffic was the least of their concerns as they stood there, looking silently eastward. For half a mile or so on either side of them, the city continued—they could see church steeples, a strip of fast food places (Arby’s, Wendy’s, McD’s, Pizza Hut, and one Eddie had never heard of called Boing Boing Burgers), car dealerships, the roof of a bowling alley <a id="page-96"></a>called Heartland Lanes. They could see another turnpike exit ahead, the sign by the ramp reading Topeka State Hospital and S. W. 6th. Beyond the off-ramp there hulked a massive old red brick edifice with tiny windows peering like desperate eyes out of the climbing ivy. Eddie figured a place that looked so much like Attica <i class="calibre">had</i> to be a hospital, probably the kind of welfare purgatory where poor folks sat in shitty plastic chairs for hours on end, all so some doctor could look at them like they were dogshit.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Beyond the hospital, the city abruptly ended and the thinny began.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">To Eddie, it looked like flat water standing in a vast marshland. It crowded up to the raised barrel of I-70 on both sides, silvery and shimmering, making the signs and guardrails and stalled cars waver like mirages; it gave off that liquidy humming sound like a stench.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah put her hands to her ears, her mouth drawn down. “I don’t know as I can stand it. Really. I don’t mean to be spleeny, but already I feel like vomiting, and I haven’t had anything to eat all day.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie felt the same way. Yet, sick as he felt he could hardly take his eyes away from the thinny. It was as if unreality had been given . . . what? A face? No. The vast and humming silver shimmer ahead of them had no face, was the very antithesis of a face, in fact, but it had a body . . . an aspect . . . a <i class="calibre">presence</i>.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Yes; that last was best. It had a presence, as the demon which had come to the circle of stones while they were trying to draw Jake had had a presence.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland, meanwhile, was rummaging in the depths of his purse. He appeared to dig all the way to the bottom before finding what he wanted: a fistful of bullets. He plucked Susannah’s right hand off the arm of her chair, and put two of the bullets in her palm. Then he took two more and poked them, slug ends first, into his ears. Susannah looked first amazed, then amused, then doubtful. In the end, she followed his example. Almost at once an expression of blissful relief filled her face.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie unshouldered the pack he wore and pulled out the half-full box of .44s that went with Jake’s Ruger. The gunslinger shook his head and held out his hand. There were still four bullets in it, two for Eddie and two for Jake.</p>
  <a id="page-97">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“What’s wrong with these?” Eddie shook a couple of shells from the box that had come from behind the hanging files in Elmer Chambers’s desk drawer.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They’re from your world and they won’t block out the sound. Don’t ask me how I know that; I just do. Try them if you want, but they won’t work.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie pointed at the bullets Roland was offering. “Those are from our world, too. The gun-shop on Seventh and Forty-ninth. Clements’, wasn’t that the name?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“These didn’t come from there. These are mine, Eddie, reloaded often but originally brought from the green land. From Gilead.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You mean the <i class="calibre">wets</i>?” Eddie asked incredulously. “The last of the wet shells from the beach? The ones that really got soaked?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland nodded.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You said those would never fire again! No matter how dry they got! That the powder had been . . . what did you say? ‘Flattened.’ ”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland nodded again.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“So why’d you save them? Why bring a bunch of useless bullets all this way?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What did I teach you to say after a kill, Eddie? In order to focus your mind?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“ ‘Father, guide my hands and heart so that no part of the animal will be wasted.’ ”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland nodded a third time. Jake took two shells and put them in his ears. Eddie took the last two, but first he tried the ones he’d shaken from the box. They muffled the sound of the thinny, but it was still there, vibrating in the center of his forehead, making his eyes water the way they did when he had a cold, making the bridge of his nose feel like it was going to explode. He picked them out, and put the bigger slugs—the ones from Roland’s ancient revolvers—in their place. <i class="calibre">Putting bullets in my ears,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre">Ma would shit.</i> But that didn’t matter. The sound of the thinny was gone—or at least down to a distant drone—and that was what did. When he turned and spoke to Roland, he expected his own voice to sound muffled, the way it did when you were wearing earplugs, but he found he could hear himself pretty well.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Is there anything you <i class="calibre">don’t</i> know?” he asked Roland.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes,” Roland said. “Quite a lot.”</p>
  <a id="page-98">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“What about Oy?” Jake asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Oy will be fine, I think,” Roland said. “Come on, let’s make some miles before dark.”</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">7</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Oy didn’t seem bothered by the warble of the thinny, but he stuck close to Jake Chambers all that afternoon, looking mistrustfully at the stalled cars which clogged the eastbound lanes of I-70. And yet, Susannah saw, those cars did not clog the highway completely. The congestion eased as the travellers left downtown behind them, but even where the traffic had been heavy, some of the dead vehicles had been pulled to one side or the other; a number had been pushed right off the highway and onto the median strip, which was a concrete divider in the metro area and grass outside of town.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Somebody’s been at work with a wrecker, that’s my guess,</i> Susannah thought. The idea made her happy. No one would have bothered clearing a path down the center of the highway while the plague was still raging, and if someone had done it after—if someone had been <i class="calibre">around</i> to do it after—that meant the plague hadn’t gotten everyone; those crammed-together obituaries weren’t the whole story.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">There were corpses in some of the cars, but they, like the ones at the foot of the station steps, were dry, not runny—mummies wearing seatbelts, for the most part. The majority of the cars were empty. A lot of the drivers and passengers caught in the traffic jams had probably tried to walk out of the plague-zone, she supposed, but she guessed that wasn’t the only reason they had taken to their feet.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah knew that she herself would have to be chained to the steering wheel to keep her inside a car once she felt the symptoms of some fatal disease setting in; if she was going to die, she would want to do it in God’s open air. A hill would be best, someplace with a little elevation, but even a wheatfield would do, came it to that. Anything but coughing your last while smelling the air-freshener dangling from the rearview mirror.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">At one time Susannah guessed they would have been able to see many of the corpses of the fleeing dead, but not now. Because of the thinny. They approached it steadily, and she knew exactly when they entered it. A kind of tingling shudder <a id="page-99"></a>ran through her body, making her draw her shortened legs up, and the wheelchair stopped for a moment. When she turned around she saw Roland, Eddie, and Jake holding their stomachs and grimacing. They looked as if they had all been stricken with the bellyache at the same time. Then Eddie and Roland straightened up. Jake bent to stroke Oy, who had been staring at him anxiously.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You boys all right?” Susannah asked. The question came out in the half-querulous, half-humorous voice of Detta Walker. Using that voice was nothing she planned; sometimes it just came out.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yeah,” Jake said. “Feels like I got a bubble in my throat, though.” He was staring uneasily at the thinny. Its silvery blankness was all around them now, as if the whole world had turned into a flat Norfolk fen at dawn. Nearby, trees poked out of its silver surface, casting distorted reflections that never stayed quite still or quite in focus. A little farther away, Susannah could see a grain-storage tower, seeming to float. The words <span class="smallcap">GADDISH FEEDS</span> were written on the side in pink letters which might have been red under normal conditions.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Feels to me like I got a bubble in my <i class="calibre">mind,</i>” Eddie said. “Man, look at that shit shimmer.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Can you still hear it?” Susannah asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yeah. But faint. I can live with it. Can you?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Uh-huh. Let’s go.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">It was like riding in an open-cockpit plane through broken clouds, Susannah decided. They’d go for what felt like miles through that humming brightness that was not quite fog and not quite water, sometimes seeing shapes (a barn, a tractor, a Stuckey’s billboard) loom out of it, then losing everything but the road, which ran consistently above the thinny’s bright but somehow indistinct surface.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Then, all at once, they would run into the clear. The humming would fall away to a faint drone; you could even unplug your ears and not be too bothered, at least until you got near the other side of the break. Once again there were vistas . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Well, no, that was too grand, Kansas didn’t exactly <i class="calibre">have</i> vistas, but there were open fields and the occasional copse of autumn-bright trees marking a spring or cow-pond. No Grand Canyon or surf crashing on Portland Headlight, but at least you could see a by-God <i class="calibre">horizon</i> off in the distance, and lose some of that unpleasant feeling of entombment. Then, back <a id="page-100"></a>into the goop you went. Jake came closest to describing it, she thought, when he said that being in the thinny was like finally reaching the shining water-mirage you could often see far up the highway on hot days.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Whatever it was and however you described it, being inside it was claustrophobic, purgatorial, all the world gone except for the twin barrels of the turnpike and the hulks of the cars, like derelict ships abandoned on a frozen ocean.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Please help us get out of this,</i> Susannah prayed to a God in whom she no longer precisely believed—she still believed in <i class="calibre">something,</i> but since awakening to Roland’s world on the beach of the Western Sea, her concept of the invisible world had changed considerably. <i class="calibre">Please help us find the Beam again. Please help us escape this world of silence and death.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">They ran into the biggest clear space they had yet come to near a roadsign which read <span class="smallcap">BIG SPRINGS</span> 2 MI. Behind them, in the west, the setting sun shone through a brief rift in the clouds, skipping scarlet splinters across the top of the thinny and lighting the windows and taillights of the stalled cars in tones of fire. On either side of them empty fields stretched away. <i class="calibre">Full Earth come and gone,</i> Susannah thought. <i class="calibre">Reaping come and gone, too. This is what Roland calls closing the year.</i> The thought made her shiver.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We’ll camp here for the night,” Roland said soon after they had passed the Big Springs exit ramp. Up ahead they could see the thinny encroaching on the highway again, but that was miles farther on—you could see a damn long way in eastern Kansas, Susannah was discovering. “We can get firewood without going too near the thinny, and the sound won’t be too bad. We may even be able to sleep without bullets stuffed into our ears.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie and Jake climbed over the guardrails, descended the bank, and foraged for wood along a dry creekbed, staying together as Roland admonished them to do. When they came back, the clouds had gulped the sun again, and an ashy, uninteresting twilight had begun to creep over the world.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger stripped twigs for kindling, then laid his fuel around them in his usual fashion, building a kind of wooden chimney in the breakdown lane. As he did it, Eddie strolled across to the median strip and stood there, hands in pockets, looking east. After a few moments, Jake and Oy joined him.</p>
  <a id="page-101">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland produced his flint and steel, scraped fire into the shaft of his chimney, and soon the little campfire was burning.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Roland!” Eddie called. “Suze! Come over here! Look at this!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah started rolling her chair toward Eddie, then Roland—after a final check of his campfire—took hold of the handles and pushed her.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Look at what?” Susannah asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie pointed. At first Susannah saw nothing, although the turnpike was perfectly visible even beyond the point where the thinny closed in again, perhaps three miles ahead. Then . . . yes, she might see something. Maybe. A kind of shape, at the farthest edge of vision. If not for the fading daylight . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Is it a building?” Jake asked. “Cripes, it looks like it’s built right across the highway!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What about it, Roland?” Eddie asked. “You’ve got the best eyes in the universe.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">For a time the gunslinger said nothing, only looked up the median strip with his thumbs hooked in his gunbelt. At last he said, “We’ll see it better when we get closer.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Oh, come on!” Eddie said. “I mean, holy shit! Do you know what it is or not?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We’ll see it better when we get closer,” the gunslinger repeated . . . which was, of course, no answer at all. He moseyed back across the eastbound lanes to check on his campfire, bootheels clicking on the pavement. Susannah looked at Jake and Eddie. She shrugged. They shrugged back . . . and then Jake burst into bright peals of laughter. Usually, Susannah thought, the kid acted more like an eighteen-year-old than a boy of eleven, but that laughter made him sound about nine-going-on-ten, and she didn’t mind a bit.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She looked down at Oy, who was looking at them earnestly and rolling his shoulders in an effort to shrug.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">8</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">They ate the leaf-wrapped delicacies Eddie called gunslinger burritos, drawing closer to the fire and feeding it more wood as the dark drew down. Somewhere south a bird cried out—it was just about the loneliest sound he had ever heard in his life, Eddie reckoned. None of them talked much, and it occurred to him that, at this time of their day, hardly anyone <a id="page-102"></a>ever did. As if the time when the earth swapped day for dark was special, a time that somehow closed them off from the powerful fellowship Roland called <i class="calibre">ka-tet</i>.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake fed Oy small scraps of dried deermeat from his last burrito; Susannah sat on her bedroll, legs crossed beneath her hide smock, looking dreamily into the fire; Roland lay back on his elbows, looking up at the sky, where the clouds had begun to melt away from the stars. Looking up himself, Eddie saw that Old Star and Old Mother were gone, their places taken by Polaris and the Big Dipper. This might not be his world—Takuro automobiles, the Kansas City Monarchs, and a food franchise called Boing Boing Burgers all suggested it wasn’t—but Eddie thought it was too close for comfort. <i class="calibre">Maybe,</i> he thought, <i class="calibre">the world next door.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">When the bird cried in the distance again, he roused himself and looked at Roland. “You had something you were going to tell us,” he said. “A thrilling tale of your youth, I believe. Susan—that was her name, wasn’t it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">For a moment longer the gunslinger continued to look up at the sky—now it was Roland who must find himself adrift in the constellations, Eddie realized—and then he shifted his gaze to his friends. He looked strangely apologetic, strangely uneasy. “Would you think I was cozening,” he said, “if I asked for one more day to think of these things? Or perhaps it’s a night to dream of them that I really want. They are old things, dead things, perhaps, but I . . .” He raised his hands in a kind of distracted gesture. “Some things don’t rest easy even when they’re dead. Their bones cry out from the ground.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“There are ghosts,” Jake said, and in his eyes Eddie saw a shadow of the horror he must have felt inside the house in Dutch Hill. The horror he must have felt when the Doorkeeper came out of the wall and reached for him. “Sometimes there are ghosts, and sometimes they come back.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes,” Roland said. “Sometimes there are, and sometimes they do.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Maybe it’s better not to brood,” Susannah said. “Sometimes—especially when you know a thing’s going to be hard—it’s better just to get on your horse and ride.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland thought this over carefully, then raised his eyes to look at her. “At tomorrow night’s fire I will tell you of Susan,” he said. “This I promise on my father’s name.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Do we need to hear?” Eddie asked abruptly. He was <a id="page-103"></a>almost astounded to hear this question coming out of his mouth; no one had been more curious about the gunslinger’s past than Eddie himself. “I mean, if it really hurts, Roland . . . hurts big-time . . . maybe . . .”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’m not sure you need to hear, but I think I need to tell. Our future is the Tower, and to go toward it with a whole heart, I must put my past to rest as best I may. There’s no way I could tell you all of it—in my world even the past is in motion, rearranging itself in many vital ways—but this one story may stand for all the rest.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Is it a Western?” Jake asked suddenly.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland looked at him, puzzled. “I don’t take your meaning, Jake. Gilead is a Barony of the Western World, yes, and Mejis as well, but—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’ll be a Western,” Eddie said. “All Roland’s stories are Westerns, when you get right down to it.” He lay back and pulled his blanket over him. Faintly, from both east and west, he could hear the warble of the thinny. He checked in his pocket for the bullets Roland had given him, and nodded with satisfaction when he felt them. He reckoned he could sleep without them tonight, but he would want them again tomorrow. They weren’t done turnpikin’ just yet.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah leaned over him, kissed the tip of his nose. “Done for the day, sugar?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yep,” Eddie said, and laced his hands together behind his head. “It’s not every day that I hook a ride on the world’s fastest train, destroy the world’s smartest computer, and then discover that everyone’s been scragged by the flu. All before dinner, too. Shit like that makes a man tired.” Eddie smiled and closed his eyes. He was still smiling when sleep took him.</p>

  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">In his dream, they were all standing on the corner of Second Avenue and Forty-sixth Street, looking over the short board fence and into the weedy vacant lot behind it. They were wearing their Mid-World clothes—a motley combination of deerskin and old shirts, mostly held together with spit and shoelaces—but none of the pedestrians hurrying by on Second seemed to notice. No one noticed the billy-bumbler in Jake’s arms or the artillery they were packing, either.</p>
  <a id="page-104">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Because we’re ghosts,</i> Eddie thought. <i class="calibre">We’re ghosts and we don’t rest easy.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">On the fence there were handbills—one for the Sex Pistols (a reunion tour, according to the poster, and Eddie thought that was pretty funny—the Pistols was one group that was <i class="calibre">never</i> going to get back together), one for a comic, Adam Sandler, that Eddie had never heard of, one for a movie called <i class="calibre">The Craft,</i> about teenage witches. Beyond that one, written in letters the dusky pink of summer roses, was this:</p>
  <blockquote class="calibre5">
   <p class="also-by-title">See the <span class="smallcap">BEAR</span> of fearsome size!</p>
<p class="calibre2">All the <span class="smallcap">WORLD</span>’<span class="smallcap">S</span> within his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">
    <span class="smallcap">TIME</span> grows thin, the past’s a riddle;</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <span class="smallcap">TOWER</span> awaits you in the middle.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“There,”</i> Jake said, pointing. <i class="calibre">“The rose. See how it awaits us, there in the middle of the lot.”</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“Yes, it’s very beautiful,”</i> Susannah said. Then she pointed to the sign standing near the rose and facing Second Avenue. Her voice and her eyes were troubled. <i class="calibre">“But what about that?”</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">According to the sign, two outfits—Mills Construction and Sombra Real Estate—were going to combine on something called Turtle Bay Condominiums, said condos to be erected on this very spot. When? <span class="smallcap">COMING SOON</span> was all the sign had to say in that regard.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“I wouldn’t worry about that,”</i> Jake said. <i class="calibre">“That sign was here before. It’s probably old as the hi—”</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">At that moment the revving sound of an engine tore into the air. From beyond the fence, on the Forty-sixth Street side of the lot, chugs of dirty brown exhaust ascended like bad-news smoke signals. Suddenly the boards on that side burst open, and a huge red bulldozer lunged through. Even the blade was red, although the words slashed across its scoop—<span class="smallcap">ALL HAIL THE CRIMSON KING</span>—were written in a yellow as bright as panic. Sitting in the peak-seat, his rotting face leering at them from above the controls, was the man who had kidnapped Jake from the bridge over the River Send—their old pal Gasher. On the front of his cocked-back hardhat, the words <span class="smallcap">LAMERK FOUNDRY</span> stood out in black. Above them, a single staring eye had been painted.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Gasher lowered the ’dozer’s blade. It tore across the lot on <a id="page-105"></a>a diagonal, smashing brick, pulverizing beer and soda bottles to glittering powder, striking sparks from the rocks. Directly in its path, the rose nodded its delicate head.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“Let’s see you ask some of yer silly questions now!”</i> this unwelcome apparition cried. <i class="calibre">“Ask all yer wants, my dear little culls, why not? Wery fond of riddles is yer old pal Gasher! Just so you understand that, no matter what yer ask, I’m gointer run that nasty thing over, mash it flat, aye, so I will! Then back over it I’ll go! Root and branch, my dear little culls! Aye, root and branch!”</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah shrieked as the scarlet bulldozer blade bore down on the rose, and Eddie grabbed for the fence. He would vault over it, throw himself on the rose, try to protect it . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">. . . except it was too late. And he knew it.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He looked back up at the cackling thing in the bulldozer’s peak-seat and saw that Gasher was gone. Now the man at the controls was Engineer Bob, from <i class="calibre">Charlie the Choo-Choo.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“Stop!”</i> Eddie screamed. <i class="calibre">“For Christ’s sake, stop!”</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“I can’t, Eddie. The world has moved on, and I can’t stop. I must move on with it.”</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">And as the shadow of the ’dozer fell over the rose, as the blade tore through one of the posts holding up the sign (Eddie saw <span class="smallcap">COMING SOON</span> had changed to <span class="smallcap">COMING NOW</span>), he realized that the man at the controls wasn’t Engineer Bob, either.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">It was Roland.</p>

  <p class="para-flush">Eddie sat up in the breakdown lane of the turnpike, gasping breath he could see in the air and with sweat already chilling on his hot skin. He was sure he had screamed, <i class="calibre">must</i> have screamed, but Susannah still slept beside him with only the top of her head poking out of the bedroll they shared, and Jake was snoring softly off to the left, one arm out of his own blankets and curled around Oy. The bumbler was also sleeping.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland wasn’t. Roland sat calmly on the far side of the dead campfire, cleaning his guns by starlight and looking at Eddie.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Bad dreams.” Not a question.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yeah.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“A visit from your brother?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie shook his head.</p>
  <a id="page-106">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“The Tower, then? The field of roses and the Tower?” Roland’s face remained impassive, but Eddie could hear the subtle eagerness which always came into his voice when the subject was the Dark Tower. Eddie had once called the gunslinger a Tower junkie, and Roland hadn’t denied it.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Not this time.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What, then?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie shivered. “Cold.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes. Thank your gods there’s no rain, at least. Autumn rain’s an evil to be avoided whenever one may. What was your dream?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Still Eddie hesitated. “You’d never betray us, would you, Roland?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No man can say that for sure, Eddie, and I have already played the betrayer more than once. To my shame. But . . . I think those days are over. We are one, <i class="calibre">ka-tet.</i> If I betray any one of you—even Jake’s furry friend, perhaps—I betray myself. Why do you ask?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“And you’d never betray your quest.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Renounce the Tower? No, Eddie. Not that, not ever. Tell me your dream.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie did, omitting nothing. When he had finished, Roland looked down at his guns, frowning. They seemed to have reassembled themselves while Eddie was talking.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“So what does it mean, that I saw you driving that ’dozer at the end? That I still don’t trust you? That subconsciously—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Is this ology-of-the-psyche? The cabala I have heard you and Susannah speak of?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes, I guess it is.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’s shit,” Roland said dismissively. “Mudpies of the mind. Dreams either mean nothing or everything—and when they mean everything, they almost always come as messages from . . . well, from other levels of the Tower.” He gazed at Eddie shrewdly. “And not all messages are sent by friends.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Something or someone is fucking with my head? Is that what you mean?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I think it possible. But you must watch me all the same. I bear watching, as you well know.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I trust you,” Eddie said, and the very awkwardness with which he spoke lent his words sincerity. Roland looked touched, almost shaken, and Eddie wondered how he ever could have thought this man an emotionless robot. Roland <a id="page-107"></a>might be a little short on imagination, but he had feelings, all right.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“One thing about your dream concerns me very much, Eddie.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The bulldozer?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The machine, yes. The threat to the rose.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Jake saw the rose, Roland. It was fine.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland nodded. “In his when, the when of that particular day, the rose was thriving. But that doesn’t mean it will continue to do so. If the construction the sign spoke of comes . . . if the <i class="calibre">bulldozer</i> comes . . .”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“There are other worlds than these,” Eddie said. “Remember?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Some things may exist only in one. In one <i class="calibre">where,</i> in one <i class="calibre">when</i>.” Roland lay down and looked up at the stars. “We must protect that rose,” he said. “We must protect it at all costs.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You think it’s another door, don’t you? One that opens on the Dark Tower.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger looked at him from eyes that ran with starshine. “I think it may <i class="calibre">be</i> the Tower,” he said. “And if it’s destroyed—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">His eyes closed. He said no more.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie lay awake late.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">11</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The new day dawned clear and bright and cold. In the strong morning sunlight, the thing Eddie had spotted the evening before was more clearly visible . . . but he still couldn’t tell what it was. Another riddle, and he was getting damned sick of them.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He stood squinting at it, shading his eyes from the sun, with Susannah on one side of him and Jake on the other. Roland was back by the campfire, packing what he called their <i class="calibre">gunna,</i> a word which seemed to mean all their worldly goods. He appeared not to be concerned with the thing up ahead, or to know what it was.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">How far away? Thirty miles? Fifty? The answer seemed to depend on how far could you see in all this flat land, and Eddie didn’t know the answer. One thing he felt quite sure of was that Jake had been right on at least two counts—it was some kind of building, and it sprawled across all four lanes of <a id="page-108"></a>the highway. It must; how else could they see it? It would have been lost in the thinny . . . wouldn’t it?</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Maybe it’s standing in one of those open patches—what Suze calls “the holes in the clouds.” Or maybe the thinny ends before we get that far. Or maybe it’s a goddam hallucination. In any case, you might as well put it out of your mind for the time being. Got a little more turnpikin’ to do.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">Still, the building held him. It looked like an airy Arabian Nights confection of blue and gold . . . except Eddie had an idea that the blue was stolen from the sky and the gold from the newly risen sun.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Roland, come here a second!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">At first he didn’t think the gunslinger would, but then Roland cinched a rawhide lace on Susannah’s pack, rose, put his hands in the small of his back, stretched, and walked over to them.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Gods, one would think no one in this band has the wit to housekeep but me,” Roland said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We’ll pitch in,” Eddie said, “we always do, don’t we? But look at that thing first.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland did, but only with a quick glance, as if he did not even want to acknowledge it.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’s glass, isn’t it?” Eddie asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland took another brief look. “I wot,” he said, a phrase which seemed to mean <i class="calibre">Reckon so, partner.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We’ve got lots of glass buildings where I come from, but most of them are office buildings. That thing up ahead looks more like something from Disney World. Do you know what it is?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Then why don’t you want to look at it?” Susannah asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland <i class="calibre">did</i> take another look at the distant blaze of light on glass, but once again it was quick—little more than a peek.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Because it’s trouble,” Roland said, “and it’s in our road. We’ll get there in time. No need to live in trouble until trouble comes.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Will we get there today?” Jake asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland shrugged, his face still closed. “There’ll be water if God wills it,” he said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Christ, you could have made a fortune writing fortune cookies,” Eddie said. He hoped for a smile, at least, but got none. Roland simply walked back across the road, dropped to <a id="page-109"></a>one knee, shouldered his purse and his pack, and waited for the others. When they were ready, the pilgrims resumed their walk east along Interstate 70. The gunslinger led, walking with his head down and his eyes on the toes of his boots.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">12</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Roland was quiet all day, and as the building ahead of them neared (<i class="calibre">trouble, and in our road,</i> he had said), Susannah came to realize it wasn’t grumpiness they were seeing, or worry about anything which lay any farther ahead of them than tonight. It was the story he’d promised to tell them that Roland was thinking about, and he was a lot more than worried.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">By the time they stopped for their noon meal, they could clearly see the building ahead—a many-turreted palace which appeared to be made entirely of reflective glass. The thinny lay close around it, but the palace rose serenely above all, its turrets trying for the sky. Madly strange here in the flat countryside of eastern Kansas, of course it was, but Susannah thought it the most beautiful building she had ever seen in her life; even more beautiful than the Chrysler Building, and that was going some.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As they drew closer, she found it more and more difficult to look elsewhere. Watching the reflections of the puffy clouds sailing across the glass castle’s blue-sky wains and walls was like watching some splendid illusion . . . yet there was a solidity to it, as well. An inarguability. Some of that was probably just the shadow it threw—mirages did not, so far as she knew, create shadows—but not all. It just <i class="calibre">was.</i> She had no idea what such a fabulosity was doing out here in the land of Stuckey’s and Hardee’s (not to mention Boing Boing Burgers), but there it was. She reckoned that time would tell the rest.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">13</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">They made camp in silence, watched Roland build the wooden chimney that would be their fire in silence, then sat before it in silence, watching the sunset turn the huge glass edifice ahead of them into a castle of fire. Its towers and battlements glowed first a fierce red, then orange, then a gold <a id="page-110"></a>which cooled rapidly to ocher as Old Star appeared in the firmament above them—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">No,</i> she thought in Detta’s voice. <i class="calibre">Ain’t dat one, girl. Not ’tall. That’s the North Star. Same one you seen back home, sittin on yo’ daddy’s lap.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">But it was Old Star she wanted, she discovered; Old Star and Old Mother. She was astounded to find herself homesick for Roland’s world, and then wondered why she should be so surprised. It was a world, after all, where no one had called her a nigger bitch (at least not yet), a world where she had found someone to love . . . and made good friends as well. That last made her feel a little bit like crying, and she hugged Jake to her. He let himself be hugged, smiling, his eyes half-closed. At some distance, unpleasant but bearable even without bullet earplugs, the thinny warbled its moaning song.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">When the last traces of yellow began to fade from the castle up the road, Roland left them to sit in the turnpike travel lane and returned to his fire. He cooked more leaf-wrapped deermeat, and handed the food around. They ate in silence (Roland actually ate almost nothing, Susannah observed). By the time they were finished, they could see the Milky Way scattered across the walls of the castle ahead of them, fierce points of reflection that burned like fire in still water.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Eddie was the one who finally broke the silence. “You don’t have to,” he said. “You’re excused. Or absolved. Or whatever the hell it is you need to take that look off your face.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland ignored him. He drank, tilting the waterskin up on his elbow like some hick drinking moonshine from a jug, head back, eyes on the stars. The last mouthful he spat to the roadside.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Life for your crop,” Eddie said. He did not smile.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland said nothing, but his cheek went pale, as if he had seen a ghost. Or heard one.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">14</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The gunslinger turned to Jake, who looked back at him seriously. “I went through the trial of manhood at the age of fourteen, the youngest of my <i class="calibre">ka-tel</i>—of my class, you would say—and perhaps the youngest ever. I told you some of that, Jake. Do you remember?”</p>
  <a id="page-111">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">You told</i> all <i class="calibre">of us some of that,</i> Susannah thought, but kept her mouth shut, and warned Eddie with her eyes to do the same. Roland hadn’t been himself during that telling; with Jake both dead and alive within his head, the man had been fighting madness.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You mean when we were chasing Walter,” Jake said. “After the way station but before I . . . I took my fall.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’s right.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I remember a little, but that’s all. The way you remember the stuff you dream about.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland nodded. “Listen, then. I would tell you more this time, Jake, because you are older. I suppose we all are.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susannah was no less fascinated with the story the second time: how the boy Roland had chanced to discover Marten, his father’s advisor (his father’s <i class="calibre">wizard</i>) in his mother’s apartment. Only none of it had been by chance, of course; the boy would have passed her door with no more than a glance had Marten not opened it and invited him in. Marten had told Roland that his mother wanted to see him, but one look at her rueful smile and downcast eyes as she sat in her low-back chair told the boy he was the last person in the world Gabrielle Deschain wanted to see just then.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The flush on her cheek and the love-bite on the side of her neck told him everything else.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Thus had he been goaded by Marten into an early trial of manhood, and by employing a weapon his teacher had not expected—his hawk, David—Roland had defeated Cort, taken his stick . . . and made the enemy of his life in Marten Broadcloak.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Beaten badly, face swelling into something that looked like a child’s goblin mask, slipping toward a coma, Cort had fought back unconsciousness long enough to offer his newest apprentice gunslinger counsel: stay away from Marten yet awhile, Cort had said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“He told me to let the story of our battle grow into a legend,” the gunslinger told Eddie, Susannah, and Jake. “To wait until my shadow had grown hair on its face and haunted Marten in his dreams.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Did you take his advice?” Susannah asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I never got a chance,” Roland said. His face cracked in a rueful, painful smile. “I meant to think about it, and seriously, but before I even got started on my thinking, things . . . changed.”</p>
  <a id="page-112">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“They have a way of doing that, don’t they?” Eddie said. “My goodness, yes.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I buried my hawk, the first weapon I ever wielded, and perhaps the finest. Then—and this part I’m sure I didn’t tell you before, Jake—I went into the lower town. That summer’s heat broke in storms full of thunder and hail, and in a room above one of the brothels where Cort had been wont to roister, I lay with a woman for the first time.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He poked a stick thoughtfully into the fire, seemed to become aware of the unconscious symbolism in what he was doing, and threw it away with a lopsided grin. It landed, smoldering, near the tire of an abandoned Dodge Aspen and went out.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It was good. The sex was good. Not the great thing I and my friends had thought about and whispered about and wondered about, of course—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I think store-bought pussy tends to be overrated by the young, sugar,” Susannah said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I fell asleep listening to the sots downstairs singing along with the piano and to the sound of hail on the window. I awoke the next morning in . . . well . . . let’s just say I awoke in a way I never would have expected to awake in such a place.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jake fed fresh fuel to the fire. It flared up, painting highlights on Roland’s cheeks, brushing crescents of shadow beneath his brows and below his lower lip. And as he talked, Susannah found she could almost see what had happened on that long-ago morning that must have smelled of wet cobblestones and rain-sweetened summer air; what had happened in a whore’s crib above a drinking-dive in the lower town of Gilead, Barony seat of New Canaan, one small mote of land located in the western regions of Mid-World.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">One boy, still aching from his battle of the day before and newly educated in the mysteries of sex. One boy, now looking twelve instead of fourteen, his lashes dusting down thick upon his cheeks, the lids shuttering those extraordinary blue eyes; one boy with his hand loosely cupping a whore’s breast, his hawk-scarred wrist lying tanned upon the counterpane. One boy in the final instants of his life’s last good sleep, one boy who will shortly be in motion, who will be falling as a dislodged pebble falls on a steep and broken slope of scree; a falling pebble that strikes another, and another, and another, <a id="page-113"></a>those pebbles striking yet more, until the whole slope is in motion and the earth shakes with the sound of the landslide.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">One boy, one pebble on a slope loose and ready to slide.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">A knot exploded in the fire. Somewhere in this dream of Kansas, an animal yipped. Susannah watched sparks swirl up past Roland’s incredibly ancient face and saw in that face the sleeping boy of a summer’s morn, lying in a bawd’s bed. And then she saw the door crash open, ending Gilead’s last troubled dream.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">15</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The man who strode in, crossing the room to the bed before Roland could open his eyes (and before the woman beside him had even begun to register the sound), was tall, slim, dressed in faded jeans and a dusty shirt of blue chambray. On his head was a dark gray hat with a snakeskin band. Lying low on his hips were two old leather holsters. Jutting from them were the sandalwood grips of the pistols the boy would someday bear to lands of which this scowling man with the furious blue eyes would never dream.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland was in motion even before he was able to unseal his eyes, rolling to the left, groping beneath the bed for what was there. He was fast, so fast it was scary, but—and Susannah saw this, too, saw it clearly—the man in the faded jeans was faster yet. He grabbed the boy’s shoulder and yanked, turning him naked out of bed and onto the floor. The boy sprawled there, reaching again for what was beneath the bed, lightning-quick. The man in the jeans stamped down on his fingers before they could grasp.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Bastard!” the boy gasped. “Oh, you bas—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">But now his eyes were open, he looked up, and saw that the invading bastard was his father.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The whore was sitting up now, her eyes puffy, her face slack and petulant. “Here!” she cried. “Here, here! You can’t just be a-comin in like that, so you can’t! Why, if I was to raise my voice—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Ignoring her, the man reached beneath the bed and dragged out two gunbelts. Near the end of each was a holstered revolver. They were large, and amazing in this largely gunless world, but they were not so large as those worn by Roland’s father, and the grips were eroded metal plates rather than <a id="page-114"></a>inlaid wood. When the whore saw the guns on the invader’s hips and the ones in his hands—the ones her young customer of the night before had been wearing until she had taken him upstairs and divested him of all weapons save for the one with which she was most familiar—the expression of sleepy petulance left her face. What replaced it was the foxlike look of a born survivor. She was up, out of bed, across the floor, and out the door before her bare bum had more than a brief moment to twinkle in the morning sun.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Neither the father standing by the bed nor the son lying naked upon the floor at his feet so much as looked at her. The man in the jeans held out the gunbelts which Roland had taken from the fuzer beneath the apprentices’ barracks on the previous afternoon, using Cort’s key to open the arsenal door. The man shook the belts under Roland’s very nose, as one might hold a torn garment beneath the nose of a feckless puppy that has chewed. He shook them so hard that one of the guns tumbled free. Despite his stupefaction, Roland caught it in midair.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I thought you were in the west,” Roland said. “In Cressia. After Farson and his—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland’s father slapped him hard enough to send the boy tumbling across the room and into a corner with blood pouring from one corner of his mouth. Roland’s first, appalling instinct was to raise the gun he still held.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Steven Deschain looked at him, hands on hips, reading this thought even before it was fully formed. His lips pulled back in a singularly mirthless grin, one that showed all of his teeth and most of his gums.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Shoot me if you will. Why not? Make this abortion complete. Ah, gods, I’d welcome it!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland laid the gun on the floor and pushed it away, using the back of his hand to do it. All at once he wanted his fingers nowhere near the trigger of a gun. They were no longer fully under his control, those fingers. He had discovered that yesterday, right around the time he had broken Cort’s nose.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Father, I was tested yesterday. I took Cort’s stick. I won. I’m a man.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You’re a fool,” his father said. His grin was gone now; he looked haggard and old. He sat down heavily on the whore’s bed, looked at the gunbelts he still held, and dropped them between his feet. “You’re a fourteen-year-old fool, and that’s the worst, most desperate kind.” He looked up, angry all over again, <a id="page-115"></a>but Roland didn’t mind; anger was better than that look of weariness. That look of age. “I’ve known since you toddled that you were no genius, but I never believed until yestereve that you were an idiot. To let him drive you like a cow in a chute! Gods! You have forgotten the face of your father! Say it!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">And that sparked the boy’s own anger. Everything he had done the day before he had done with his father’s face firmly fixed in his mind.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’s not true!” he shouted from where he now sat with his bare butt on the splintery boards of the whore’s crib and his back against the wall, the sun shining through the window and touching the fuzz on his fair, unscarred cheek.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It <i class="calibre">is</i> true, you whelp! Foolish whelp! Say your atonement or I’ll strip the hide from your very—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They were together!” he burst out. “Your wife and your minister—your magician! I saw the mark of his mouth on her neck! <i class="calibre">On my mother’s neck!</i>” He reached for the gun and picked it up, but even in his shame and fury was still careful not to let his fingers stray near the trigger; he held the apprentice’s revolver only by the plain, undecorated metal of its barrel. “Today I end his treacherous, seducer’s life with this, and if you aren’t man enough to help me, at least you can stand aside and let m—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">One of the revolvers on Steven’s hip was out of its holster and in his hand before Roland’s eyes saw any move. There was a single shot, deafening as thunder in the little room; it was a full minute before Roland was able to hear the babble of questions and commotion from below. The ’prentice-gun, meanwhile, was long gone, blown out of his hand and leaving nothing behind but a kind of buzzing tingle. It flew out the window, down and gone, its grip a smashed ruin of metal and its short turn in the gunslinger’s long tale at an end.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland looked at his father, shocked and amazed. Steven looked back, saying nothing for a long time. But now he wore the face Roland remembered from earliest childhood: calm and sure. The weariness and the look of half-distracted fury had passed away like last night’s thunderstorms.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">At last his father spoke. “I was wrong in what I said, and I apologize. You did not forget my face, Roland. But still you were foolish—you allowed yourself to be driven by one far slyer than you will ever be in your life. It’s only by the grace of the gods and the working of <i class="calibre">ka</i> that you have not been sent <a id="page-116"></a>west, one more true gunslinger out of Marten’s road . . . out of John Farson’s road . . . and out of the road which leads to the creature that rules them.” He stood and held out his arms. “If I had lost you, Roland, I should have died.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland got to his feet and went naked to his father, who embraced him fiercely. When Steven Deschain kissed him first on one cheek and then the other, Roland began to weep. Then, in Roland’s ear, Steven Deschain whispered six words.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">16</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">“What?” Susannah asked. “What six words?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“ ‘I have known for two years,’ ” Roland said. “That was what he whispered.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Holy Christ,” Eddie said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“He told me I couldn’t go back to the palace. If I did, I’d be dead by nightfall. He said, ‘You have been born to your destiny in spite of all Marten could do; yet he has sworn to kill you before you can grow to be a problem to him. It seems that, winner in the test or no, you must leave Gilead anyway. For only awhile, though, and you’ll go east instead of west. I’d not send you alone, either, or without a purpose.’ Then, almost as an afterthought, he added: ‘Or with a pair of sorry ’prentice revolvers.’ ”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What purpose?” Jake asked. He had clearly been captivated by the story; his eyes shone nearly as bright as Oy’s. “And which friends?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“These things you must now hear,” Roland said, “and how you judge me will come in time.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He fetched a sigh—the deep sigh of a man who contemplates some arduous piece of work—and then tossed fresh wood on the fire. As the flames flared up, driving the shadows back a little way, he began to talk. All that queerly long night he talked, not finishing the story of Susan Delgado until the sun was rising in the east and painting the glass castle yonder with all the bright hues of a fresh day, and a strange green cast of light which was its own true color.</p>
