  <p class="para-flush">While a certain whore and certain bartender were still gaping up at the bloody moon, Kimba Rimer awoke sneezing.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Damn, a cold for Reaping,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre">As much as I have to be out over the next two days, I’ll be lucky if it doesn’t turn into—</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Something fluffed the end of his nose, and he sneezed again. Coming out of his narrow chest and dry slot of a mouth, it sounded like a small-caliber pistol-shot in the black room.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Who’s there?” he cried.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">No answer. Rimer suddenly imagined a bird, something nasty and bad-tempered, that had gotten in here in daylight and was now flying around in the dark, fluttering against his face as he slept. His skin crawled—birds, bugs, bats, he hated them all—and he fumbled so energetically for the gas-lamp on the table by his bed that he almost knocked it off onto the floor.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As he drew it toward him, that flutter came again. This time puffing at his cheek. Rimer screamed and recoiled against the pillows, clutching the lamp to his chest. He turned the switch on the side, heard the hiss of gas, then pushed the spark. The lamp lit, and in the thin circle of its radiance, he saw not a fluttering bird but Clay Reynolds sitting on the edge of the bed. In one hand Reynolds held the feather with which he had been tickling Mejis’s Chancellor. His other was hidden in his cloak, which lay in his lap.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Reynolds had disliked Rimer from their first meeting in the woods far west of town—those same woods, beyond Eyebolt Canyon, where Farson’s man Latigo now quartered the main <a id="page-491"></a>contingent of his troops. It had been a windy night, and as he and the other Coffin Hunters entered the little glade where Rimer, accompanied by Lengyll and Croydon, were sitting by a small fire, Reynolds’s cloak swirled around him. <i class="calibre">“Sai Manto,”</i> Rimer had said, and the other two had laughed. It had been meant as a harmless joke, but it hadn’t seemed harmless to Reynolds. In many of the lands where he had travelled, <i class="calibre">manto</i> meant not “cloak” but “leaner” or “bender.” It was, in fact, a slang term for homosexual. That Rimer (a provincial man under his veneer of cynical sophistication) didn’t know this never crossed Reynolds’s mind. He knew when people were making small of him, and if he could make such a person pay, he did so.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">For Kimba Rimer, payday had come.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Reynolds? What are you doing? How did you get in h—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You got to be thinking of the wrong cowboy,” the man sitting on the bed replied. “No Reynolds here. Just <i class="calibre">Señor Manto.</i>” He took out the hand which had been under his cloak. In it was a keenly honed <i class="calibre">cuchillo</i>. Reynolds had purchased it in Low Market with this chore in mind. He raised it now and drove the twelve-inch blade into Rimer’s chest. It went all the way through, pinning him like a bug. <i class="calibre">A bedbug,</i> Reynolds thought.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The lamp fell out of Rimer’s hands and rolled off the bed. It landed on the foot-runner, but did not break. On the far wall was Kimba Rimer’s distorted, struggling shadow. The shadow of the other man bent over it like a hungry vulture.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Reynolds lifted the hand which had held the knife. He turned it so the small blue tattooed coffin between thumb and forefinger was in front of Rimer’s eyes. He wanted it to be the last thing Rimer saw on this side of the clearing.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Let’s hear you make fun of me now,” Reynolds said. He smiled. “Come on. Let’s just hear you.”</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">2</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Shortly before five o’clock, Mayor Thorin woke from a terrible dream. In it, a bird with pink eyes had been cruising slowly back and forth above the Barony. Wherever its shadow fell, the grass turned yellow, the leaves fell shocked from the trees, and the crops died. The shadow was turning his green and pleasant Barony into a waste land. <i class="calibre">It may be my Barony, <a id="page-492"></a>but it’s my bird, too,</i> he thought just before awakening, huddled into a shuddery ball on one side of his bed. <i class="calibre">My bird, I brought it here, I let it out of its cage.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">There would be no more sleep for him this night, and Thorin knew it. He poured himself a glass of water, drank it, then walked into his study, absently picking his nightgown from the cleft of his bony old ass as he went. The puff on the end of his nightcap bobbed between his shoulderblades; his knees cracked at every step.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As for the guilty feelings expressed by the dream . . . well, what was done was done. Jonas and his friends would have what they’d come for (and paid so handsomely for) in another day; a day after that, they’d be gone. Fly away, bird with the pink eyes and pestilent shadow; fly away to wherever you came from and take the Big Coffin Boys with you. He had an idea that by Year’s End he’d be too busy dipping his wick to think much about such things. Or to dream such dreams.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Besides, dreams without visible sign were just dreams, not omens.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The visible sign might have been the boots beneath the study drapes—just the scuffed tips of them showing—but Thorin never looked in that direction. His eyes were fixed on the bottle beside his favorite chair. Drinking claret at five in the morning was no sort of habit to get into, but this once wouldn’t hurt. He’d had a terrible dream, for gods’ sake, and after all—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Tomorrow’s Reaping,” he said, sitting in the wing-chair on the edge of the hearth. “I guess a man can jump a fence or two, come Reap.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He poured himself a drink, the last he’d ever take in this world, and coughed as the fire hit his belly and then climbed back up his throat, warming it. Better, aye, much. No giant birds now, no plaguey shadows. He stretched out his arms, laced his long and bony fingers together, and cracked them viciously.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I <i class="calibre">hate</i> it when you do that, you scrawny git,” spoke a voice directly into Thorin’s left ear.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Thorin jumped. His heart took its own tremendous leap in his chest. The empty glass flew from his hand, and there was no foot-runner to cushion its landing. It smashed on the hearth.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Before Thorin could scream, Roy Depape brushed off the mayoral nightcap, seized the gauzy remains of the mayoral mane, and yanked the mayoral head back. The knife Depape held in his other hand was much humbler than the one Reynolds <a id="page-493"></a>had used, but it cut the old man’s throat efficiently enough. Blood sprayed scarlet in the dim room. Depape let go of Thorin’s hair, went back to the drapes he had been hiding behind, and picked something up off the floor. It was Cuthbert’s lookout. Depape brought it back to the chair and put it in the dying Mayor’s lap.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Bird . . .” Thorin gargled through a mouthful of blood. “Bird!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yar, old fella, and trig o’ you to notice at a time like this, I will say.” Depape pulled Thorin’s head back again and took the old man’s eyes out with two quick flips of his knife. One went into the dead fireplace; the other hit the wall and slid down behind the fire-tools. Thorin’s right foot trembled briefly and was still.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">One more job to do.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Depape looked around, saw Thorin’s nightcap, and decided the ball on the end would serve. He picked it up, dipped it in the puddle of blood in the Mayor’s lap, and drew the Good Man’s <i class="calibre">sigul</i>—</p>
  <p class="image-center">

  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">—on the wall.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“There,” he murmured, standing back. “If that don’t finish em, nothing on earth will.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">True enough. The only question left unanswered was whether or not Roland’s <i class="calibre">ka-tet</i> could be taken alive.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">3</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Jonas had told Fran Lengyll exactly where to place his men, two inside the stable and six more out, three of these latter gents hidden behind rusty old implements, two hidden in the burnt-out remains of the home place, one—Dave Hollis—crouched on top of the stable itself, spying over the roofpeak. Lengyll was glad to see that the men in the posse took their job seriously. They were only boys, it was true, but boys who had on one occasion come off ahead of the Big Coffin Hunters.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Sheriff Avery gave a fair impression of being in charge of things until they got within a good shout of the Bar K. Then Lengyll, machine-gun slung over one shoulder (and as straight-backed in the saddle as he had been at twenty), took command. <a id="page-494"></a>Avery, who looked nervous and sounded out of breath, seemed relieved rather than offended.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’ll tell ye where to go as was told to me, for it’s a good plan, and I’ve no quarrel with it,” Lengyll had told his posse. In the dark, their faces were little more than dim blurs. “Only one thing I’ll say to ye on my own hook. We don’t need em alive, but it’s best we have em so—it’s the Barony we want to put paid to em, the common folk, and so put paid to this whole business, as well. Shut the door on it, if ye will. So I say this: if there’s cause to shoot, shoot. But I’ll flay the skin off the face of any man who shoots without cause. Do ye understand?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">No response. It seemed they did.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right,” Lengyll had said. His face was stony. “I’ll give ye a minute to make sure your gear’s muffled, and then on we go. Not another word from here on out.”</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">4</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Roland, Cuthbert, and Alain came out of the bunkhouse at quarter past six that morning, and stood a-row on the porch. Alain was finishing his coffee. Cuthbert was yawning and stretching. Roland was buttoning his shirt and looking southwest, toward the Bad Grass. He was thinking not of ambushes but of Susan. Her tears. <i class="calibre">Greedy old</i> ka, <i class="calibre">how I hate it,</i> she had said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">His instincts did not awake; Alain’s touch, which had sensed Jonas on the day Jonas had killed the pigeons, did not so much as quiver. As for Cuthbert—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“One more day of quiet!” that worthy exclaimed to the dawning sky. “One more day of grace! One more day of silence, broken only by the lover’s sigh and the tattoo of horses’ hoofs!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“One more day of your bullshit,” Alain said. “Come on.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They set off across the dooryard, sensing the eight pairs of eyes on them not at all. They walked into the stable past the two men flanking the door, one hidden behind an ancient harrow, the other tucked behind an untidy stack of hay, both with guns drawn.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Only Rusher sensed something was wrong. He stamped his feet, rolled his eyes, and, as Roland backed him out of his stall, tried to rear.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Hey, boy,” he said, and looked around. “Spiders, I reckon. He hates them.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Outside, Lengyll stood up and waved both hands forward. <a id="page-495"></a>Men moved silently toward the front of the stable. On the roof, Dave Hollis stood with his gun drawn. His monocle was tucked away in his vest pocket, so it should blink no badly timed reflection.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cuthbert led his mount out of the stable. Alain followed. Roland came last, short-leading the nervous, prancy gelding.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Look,” Cuthbert said cheerily, still unaware of the men standing directly behind him and his friends. He was pointing north. “A cloud in the shape of a bear! Good luck for—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Don’t move, cullies,” Fran Lengyll called. “Don’t so much as shuffle yer god-pounding feet.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Alain <i class="calibre">did</i> begin to turn—in startlement more than anything else—and there was a ripple of small clicking sounds, like many dry twigs all snapping at once. The sound of cocking pistols and musketoons.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No, Al!” Roland said. “Don’t move! Don’t!” In his throat despair rose like poison, and tears of rage stung at the corners of his eyes . . . yet he stood quiet. Cuthbert and Alain must stand quiet, too. If they moved, they’d be killed. “Don’t move!” he called again. “Either of you!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Wise, cully.” Lengyll’s voice was closer now, and accompanied by several pairs of footfalls. “Put yer hands behind ye.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Two shadows flanked Roland, long in the first light. Judging by the bulk of the one on his left, he guessed it was being thrown by Sheriff Avery. He probably wouldn’t be offering them any white tea this day. Lengyll would belong to the other shadow.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Hurry up, Dearborn, or whatever yer name may be. Get em behind ye. Small of yer back. There’s guns pointed at your pards, and if we end up taking in only two of yer instead of three, life’ll go on.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Not taking any chances with us,</i> Roland thought, and felt a moment of perverse pride. With it came a taste of something that was almost amusement. Bitter, though; that taste continued very bitter.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Roland!” It was Cuthbert, and there was agony in his voice. “Roland, don’t!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">But there was no choice. Roland put his hands behind his back. Rusher uttered a small, reproving whinny—as if to say all this was <i class="calibre">highly</i> improper—and trotted away to stand beside the bunkhouse porch.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You’re going to feel metal on your wrists,” Lengyll said.</p>
  <p class="para-flush">
   <i class="calibre">“Esposas.”</i>
  </p>
  <a id="page-496">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">Two cold circles slipped over Roland’s hands. There was a click and suddenly the arcs of the handcuffs were tight against his wrists.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right,” said another voice. “Now you, son.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Be damned if I will!” Cuthbert’s voice wavered on the edge of hysteria.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">There was a thud and a muffled cry of pain. Roland turned around and saw Alain down on one knee, the heel of his left hand pressed against his forehead. Blood ran down his face.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Ye want me to deal him another ’un?” Jake White asked. He had an old pistol in his hand, reversed so the butt was forward. “I can, you know; my arm is feeling wery limber for this early in the day.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No!” Cuthbert was twitching with horror and something like grief. Ranged behind him were three armed men, looking on with nervous avidity.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Then be a good boy an’ get yer hands behind yer.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cuthbert, still fighting tears, did as he was told. <i class="calibre">Esposas</i> were put on him by Deputy Bridger. The other two men yanked Alain to his feet. He reeled a little, then stood firm as he was handcuffed. His eyes met Roland’s, and Al tried to smile. In some ways it was the worst moment of that terrible ambush morning. Roland nodded back and made himself a promise: he would never be taken like this again, not if he lived to be a thousand years old.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Lengyll was wearing a trailscarf instead of a string tie this morning, but Roland thought he was inside the same box-tail coat he’d worn to the Mayor’s welcoming party, all those weeks ago. Standing beside him, puffing with excitement, anxiety, and self-importance, was Sheriff Avery.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Boys,” the Sheriff said, “ye’re arrested for transgressing the Barony. The specific charges are treason and murder.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Who did we murder?” Alain asked mildly, and one of the posse uttered a laugh either shocked or cynical, Roland couldn’t tell which.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The Mayor and his Chancellor, as ye know quite well,” Avery said. “Now—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“How can you do this?” Roland asked curiously. It was Lengyll to whom he spoke. “Mejis is your home place; I’ve seen the line of your fathers in the town cemetery. How can you do this to your home place, sai Lengyll?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’ve no intention of standing out here and making palaver <a id="page-497"></a>with ye,” Lengyll said. He glanced over Roland’s shoulder. “Alvarez! Get his horse! Boys as trig as this bunch should have no problem riding with their hands behind their—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No, tell me,” Roland interposed. “Don’t hold back, sai Lengyll—these are your friends you’ve come with, and not a one who isn’t inside your circle. How can you do it? Would you rape your own mother if you came upon her sleeping with her dress up?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Lengyll’s mouth twitched—not with shame or embarrassment but momentary prudish distaste, and then the old rancher looked at Avery. “They teach em to talk pretty in Gilead, don’t they?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Avery had a rifle. Now he stepped toward the handcuffed gunslinger with the butt raised. “I’ll teach ’im how to talk proper to a man of the gentry, so I will! Knock the teef straight out of his head, if you say aye, Fran!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Lengyll held him back, looking tired. “Don’t be a fool. I don’t want to bring him back laying over a saddle unless he’s dead.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Avery lowered his gun. Lengyll turned to Roland.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Ye’re not going to live long enough to profit from advice, Dearborn,” he said, “but I’ll give’ee some, anyway: stick with the winners in this world. And know how the wind blows, so ye can tell when it changes direction.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You’ve forgotten the face of your father, you scurrying little maggot,” Cuthbert said clearly.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">This got to Lengyll in a way Roland’s remark about his mother had not—it showed in the sudden bloom of color in his weathered cheeks.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Get em mounted!” he said. “I want em locked up tight within the hour!”</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">5</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Roland was boosted into Rusher’s saddle so hard he almost flew off on the other side—would have, if Dave Hollis had not been there to steady him and then to wedge Roland’s boot into the stirrup. Dave offered the gunslinger a nervous, half-embarrassed smile.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’m sorry to see you here,” Roland said gravely.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’s sorry I am to be here,” the deputy said. “If murder was your business, I wish you’d gotten to it sooner. And your <a id="page-498"></a>friend shouldn’t have been so arrogant as to leave his calling-card.” He nodded toward Cuthbert.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland hadn’t the slightest idea what Deputy Dave was referring to, but it didn’t matter. It was just part of the frame, and none of these men believed much of it, Dave likely included. Although, Roland supposed, they would come to believe it in later years and tell it to their children and grandchildren as gospel. The glorious day they’d ridden with the posse and taken down the traitors.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The gunslinger used his knees to turn Rusher . . . and there, standing by the gate between the Bar K’s dooryard and the lane leading to the Great Road, was Jonas himself. He sat astride a deep-chested bay, wearing a green felt drover’s hat and an old gray duster. There was a rifle in the scabbard beside his right knee. The left side of the duster was pulled back to expose the butt of his revolver. Jonas’s white hair, untied today, lay over his shoulders.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He doffed his hat and held it out to Roland in courtly greeting. “A good game,” he said. “You played very well for someone who was taking his milk out of a tit not so long ago.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Old man,” Roland said, “you’ve lived too long.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas smiled. “You’d remedy that if you could, wouldn’t you? Yar, I reckon.” He flicked his eyes at Lengyll. “Get their toys, Fran. Look specially sharp for knives. They’ve got guns, but not with em. Yet I know a bit more about those shooting irons than they might think. And funny boy’s slingshot. Don’t forget that, for gods’ sake. He like to take Roy’s head off with it not so long ago.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Are you talking about the carrot-top?” Cuthbert asked. His horse was dancing under him; Bert swayed back and forth and from side to side like a circus rider to keep from tumbling off. “He never would have missed his head. His balls, maybe, but not his head.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Probably true,” Jonas agreed, watching as the spears and Roland’s shortbow were taken into custody. The slingshot was on the back of Cuthbert’s belt, tucked into a holster he had made for it himself. It was very well for Roy Depape that he hadn’t tried Bert, Roland knew—Bert could take a bird on the wing at sixty yards. A pouch holding steel shot hung at the boy’s left side. Bridger took it, as well.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">While this was going on, Jonas fixed Roland with an amiable smile. “What’s your real name, brat? Fess up—no harm in <a id="page-499"></a>telling now; you’re going to ride the handsome, and we both know it.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland said nothing. Lengyll looked at Jonas, eyebrows raised. Jonas shrugged, then jerked his head in the direction of town. Lengyll nodded and poked Roland with one hard, chapped finger. “Come on, boy. Let’s ride.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland squeezed Rusher’s sides; the horse trotted toward Jonas. And suddenly Roland knew something. As with all his best and truest intuitions, it came from nowhere and everywhere—absent at one second, all there and fully dressed at the next.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Who sent you west, maggot?” he asked as he passed Jonas. “Couldn’t have been Cort—you’re too old. Was it his father?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The look of slightly bored amusement left Jonas’s face—<i class="calibre">flew</i> from his face, as if slapped away. For one amazing moment the man with the white hair was a child again: shocked, shamed, and hurt.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes, Cort’s da—I see it in your eyes. And now you’re here, on the Clean Sea . . . except you’re really in the west. The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas’s gun was out and cocked in his hand with such speed that only Roland’s extraordinary eyes were capable of marking the movement. There was a murmur from the men behind them—partly shock, mostly awe.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Jonas, don’t be a fool!” Lengyll snarled. “You ain’t killin em after we took the time and risk to hood em and tie their hooks, are ye?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas seemed to take no notice. His eyes were wide; the corners of his seamed mouth were trembling. “Watch your words, Will Dearborn,” he said in a low, hoarse voice. “You want to watch em ever so close. I got two pounds of pressure on a three-pound trigger right this second.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Fine, shoot me,” Roland said. He lifted his head and looked down at Jonas. “Shoot, exile. Shoot, worm. Shoot, you failure. You’ll still live in exile and die as you lived.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">For a moment he was sure Jonas <i class="calibre">would</i> shoot, and in that moment Roland felt death would be enough, an acceptable end after the shame of being caught so easily. In that moment Susan was absent from his mind. Nothing breathed in that moment, nothing called, nothing moved. The shadows of the men watching this confrontation, both on foot and on horseback, were printed depthless on the dirt.</p>
  <a id="page-500">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">Then Jonas dropped the hammer of his gun and slipped it back into its holster.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Take em to town and jug em,” he said to Lengyll. “And when I show up, I don’t want to see one hair harmed on one head. If I could keep from killing this one, you can keep from hurting the rest. Now go on.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Move,” Lengyll said. His voice had lost some of its bluff authority. It was now the voice of a man who realizes (too late) that he has bought chips in a game where the stakes are likely much too high.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">They rode. As they did, Roland turned one last time. The contempt Jonas saw in those cool young eyes stung him worse than the whips that had scarred his back in Garlan years ago.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">6</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">When they were out of sight, Jonas went into the bunkhouse, pulled up the board which concealed their little armory, and found only two guns. The matched set of six-shooters with the dark handles—Dearborn’s guns, surely—were gone.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">You’re in the west. The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west. You’ll live in exile and die as you lived.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas’s hands went to work, disassembling the revolvers Cuthbert and Alain had brought west. Alain’s had never even been worn, save on the practice-range. Outside, Jonas threw the pieces, scattering them every whichway. He threw as hard as he could, trying to rid himself of that cool blue gaze and the shock of hearing what he’d believed no man had known. Roy and Clay suspected, but even they hadn’t known for sure.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Before the sun went down, everyone in Mejis would know that Eldred Jonas, the white-haired regulator with the tattooed coffin on his hand, was nothing but a failed gunslinger.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">You’ll live in exile and die as you lived.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">“P’raps,” he said, looking at the burned-out ranch house without really seeing it. “But I’ll live longer than you, young Dearborn, and die long after your bones are rusting in the ground.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He mounted up and swung his horse around, sawing viciously at the reins. He rode for Citgo, where Roy and Clay would be waiting, and he rode hard, but Roland’s eyes rode with him.</p>

  <p class="para-indent">At first the words seemed to be coming from far away, drifting down by some magical means to the dark place where she lay. Even when the voice was joined by a rudely shaking hand and Susan knew she <i class="calibre">must</i> wake up, it was a long, hard struggle.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">It had been weeks since she’d gotten a decent night’s sleep, and she had expected more of the same last night . . . <i class="calibre">especially</i> last night. She had lain awake in her luxurious bedchamber at Seafront, tossing from side to side, possibilities—none good—crowding her mind. The nightgown she wore crept up to her hips and bunched at the small of her back. When she got up to use the commode, she took the hateful thing off, hurled it into a corner, and crawled back into bed naked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Being out of the heavy silk nightgown had done the trick. She dropped off almost at once . . . and in this case, <i class="calibre">dropped off</i> was exactly right: it was less like falling asleep than falling into some thoughtless, dreamless crack in the earth.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Now this intruding voice. This intruding arm, shaking her so hard that her head rolled from side to side on the pillow. Susan tried to slide away from it, pulling her knees up to her chest and mouthing fuzzy protests, but the arm followed. The shaking recommenced; the nagging, calling voice never stopped.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Wake up, sai! Wake up! In the name of the Turtle and the Bear, wake up!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Maria’s voice. Susan hadn’t recognized it at first because Maria was so upset. Susan had never heard her so, or expected to. Yet it <i class="calibre">was</i> so; the maid sounded on the verge of hysteria.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan sat up. For a moment so much input—all of it wrong—crashed in on her that she was incapable of moving. The duvet beneath which she had slept tumbled into her lap, exposing her breasts, and she could do no more than pluck weakly at it with the tips of her fingers.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The first wrong thing was the light. It flooded through the windows more strongly than it ever had before . . . because, she realized, she had never been in this room so late before. Gods, it had to be ten o’ the clock, perhaps later.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The second wrong thing was the sounds from below. Mayor’s House was ordinarily a peaceful place in the morning; until noon one heard little but <i class="calibre">casa vaqueros</i> leading the horses out <a id="page-502"></a>for their morning exercise, the whicker-whicker-whick of Miguel sweeping the courtyard, and the constant boom and shush of the waves. This morning there were shouts, curses, galloping horses, the occasional burst of strange, jagged laughter. Somewhere outside her room—perhaps not in this wing, but close—Susan heard the running thud of booted feet.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The wrongest thing of all was Maria herself, cheeks ashy beneath her olive skin-tone, and her usually neat hair tangled and unbound. Susan would have guessed only an earthquake could make her look so, if that.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Maria, what is it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You have to go, sai. Seafront maybe not safe for you just now. Your own house maybe better. When I don’t see you earlier, I think you gone there already. You chose a bad day to sleep late.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Go?” Susan asked. Slowly, she pulled the duvet all the way up to her nose and stared at Maria over it with wide, puffy eyes. “What do you mean, go?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Out the back.” Maria plucked the duvet from Susan’s sleep-numbed hands again and this time stripped it all the way down to her ankles. “Like you did before. Now, missy, now! Dress and go! Those boys put away, aye, but what if they have friends? What if they come back, kill you, too?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan had been getting up. Now all the strength ran out of her legs and she sat back down on the bed again. “Boys?” she whispered. “Boys kill who? <i class="calibre">Boys kill who?</i>”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">This was a good distance from grammatical, but Maria took her meaning.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Dearborn and his pinboys,” she said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Who are they supposed to have killed?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The Mayor and the Chancellor.” She looked at Susan with a kind of distracted sympathy. “Now get up, I tell you. And get gone. This place gone <i class="calibre">loco</i>.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They didn’t do any such thing,” Susan said, and only just restrained herself from adding, <i class="calibre">It wasn’t in the plan.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Sai Thorin and sai Rimer jus’ as dead, whoever did it.” There were more shouts below, and a sharp little explosion that didn’t sound like a firecracker. Maria looked in that direction, then began to throw Susan her clothes. “The Mayor’s eyes, they gouged right out of his head.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They couldn’t have! Maria, I know them—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Me, I don’t know nothing about them and care less—but I <a id="page-503"></a>care about you. Get dressed and get out, I tell you. Quick as you can.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What’s happened to them?” A terrible thought came to Susan and she leaped to her feet, clothes falling all around her. She seized Maria by the shoulders. “They haven’t been killed?” Susan shook her. “Say they haven’t been killed!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I don’t think so. There’s been a t’ousan’ shouts and ten t’ousan’ rumors go the rounds, but I think jus’ jailed. Only . . .”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">There was no need for her to finish; her eyes slipped from Susan’s, and that involuntary shift (along with the confused shouts from below) told all the rest. Not killed yet, but Hart Thorin had been greatly liked, and from an old family. Roland, Cuthbert, and Alain were strangers.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Not killed yet . . . but tomorrow was Reaping, and tomorrow night was Reaping Bonfire.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan began to dress as fast as she could.</p>

  <p class="para-flush">Reynolds, who had been with Jonas longer than Depape, took one look at the figure cantering toward them through the skeletal oil derricks, and turned to his partner. “Don’t ask him any questions—he’s not in any mood for silly questions this morning.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“How do you know?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Never mind. Just keep your ever-fucking gob shut.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas reined up before them. He sat slumped in his saddle, pale and thoughtful. His look prompted one question from Roy Depape in spite of Reynolds’s caution. “Eldred, are you all right?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Is anyone?” Jonas responded, then fell silent again. Behind them, Citgo’s few remaining pumpers squalled tiredly.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">At last Jonas roused himself and sat a little straighter in the saddle. “The cubs’ll be stored supplies by now. I told Lengyll and Avery to fire a double set of pistol-shots if anything went wrong, and there hasn’t been any shooting like that.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We didn’t hear none, either, Eldred,” Depape said eagerly. “Nothing atall like that.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas grimaced. “You wouldn’t, would you? Not out in this noise. Fool!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Depape bit his lip, saw something in the neighborhood of his left stirrup that needed adjusting, and bent to it.</p>
  <a id="page-504">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“Were you boys seen at your business?” Jonas asked. “This morning, I mean, when you sent Rimer and Thorin off. Even a chance either of you was seen?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Reynolds shook his head for both of them. “ ’Twas clean as could be.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas nodded as if the subject had been of only passing interest to him, then turned to regard the oilpatch and the rusty derricks. “Mayhap folks are right,” he said in a voice almost too low to hear. “Mayhap the Old People <i class="calibre">were</i> devils.” He turned back to them. “Well, we’re the devils now. Ain’t we, Clay?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Whatever you think, Eldred,” Reynolds said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I said what I think. <i class="calibre">We’re</i> the devils now, and by God, that’s how we’ll behave. What about Quint and that lot down there?” He cocked his head toward the forested slope where the ambush had been laid.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Still there, pending your word,” Reynolds said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No need of em now.” He favored Reynolds with a dark look. “That Dearborn’s a coozey brat. I wish I was going to be in Hambry tomorrow night just so I could lay a torch between his feet. I almost left him cold and dead at the Bar K. Would’ve if not for Lengyll. Coozey little brat is what he is.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Slumping as he spoke. Face growing blacker and blacker, like stormclouds drifting across the sun. Depape, his stirrup fixed, tossed Reynolds a nervous glance. Reynolds didn’t answer it. What point? If Eldred went crazy now (and Reynolds had seen it happen before), there was no way they could get out of his killing-zone in time.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Eldred, we got quite a spot more to do.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Reynolds spoke quietly, but it got through. Jonas straightened. He took off his hat, hung it on his saddle as if the horn were a coathook, and brushed absently through his hair with his fingers.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yar—quite a spot is right. Ride down there. Tell Quint to send for oxen to pull those last two full tankers out to Hanging Rock. He sh’d keep four men with him to hook em up and take em on to Latigo. The rest can go on ahead.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Reynolds now judged it safe to ask a question. “When do the rest of Latigo’s men get there?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Men?” Jonas snorted. “Don’t we wish, cully! The rest of Latigo’s <i class="calibre">boys’ll</i> ride out to Hanging Rock by moonlight, pennons no doubt flying for all the coyotes and other assorted <a id="page-505"></a>desert-dogs to see and be awed by. They’ll be ready to do escort duty by ten tomorrow, I sh’d think . . . although if they’re the sort of lads I’m expecting, fuck-ups are apt to be the rule of the day. The good news is that we don’t much need em, anyway. Things look well in hand. Now go down there, get them about their business, and then ride back to me, just as fast’s you can.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas turned and looked toward the lumpy swell of hills to the northwest.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We have business of our own,” he said. “Soonest begun, boys, soonest done. I want to shake the dust of fucking Mejis off my hat and boots as soon as I can. I don’t like the way it feels anymore. Not at all.”</p>

  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The woman, Theresa Maria Dolores O’Shyven, was forty years old, plump, pretty, mother of four, husband of Peter, a <i class="calibre">vaquero</i> of laughing temperament. She was also a seller of rugs and draperies in the Upper Market; many of the prettier and more delicate appointments at Seafront had passed through Theresa O’Shyven’s hands, and her family was quite well-to-do. Although her husband was a range-rider, the O’Shyven clan was what would have been called middle-class in another place and time. Her two oldest children were grown and gone, one right out o’ Barony. The third eldest was sparking and hoping to marry his heart’s delight at Year’s End. Only the youngest suspected something was wrong with Ma, and this one had no idea how close Theresa was to complete obsessional madness.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Soon,</i> Rhea thought, watching Theresa avidly in the ball. <i class="calibre">She’ll start doing it soon, but first she’s got to get rid of the brat.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">There was no school at Reaptide, and the stalls opened only for a few hours in the afternoon, so Theresa sent her youngest daughter off with a pie. A Reaptide gift to a neighbor, Rhea surmised, although she couldn’t hear the soundless instructions the woman gave her daughter as she pulled a knitted cap down over the girl’s ears. And ’twouldn’t be a neighbor too close, either; she’d want time, would Theresa Maria Dolores O’Shyven, time to be a-choring. It was a good-sized house, and there were a lot of corners in it that needed cleaning.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Rhea chuckled; the chuckle turned into a hollow gust of <a id="page-506"></a>coughing. In the corner, Musty looked at the old woman hauntedly. Although far from the emaciated skeleton that his mistress had become, Musty didn’t look good at all.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The girl was shown out with the pie under her arm; she paused to give her mother a single troubled look, and then the door was shut in her face.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Now!” Rhea croaked. “Them corners is waitin! Down on yer knees, woman, and get to business!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">First Theresa went to the window. When she was satisfied with what she saw—her daughter out the gate and down the High Street, likely—she turned back to her kitchen. She walked to the table and stood there, looking dreamy-eyed into space.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No, none o’ that, now!” Rhea cried impatiently. She no longer saw her own filthy hut, she no longer smelled either its rank aromas or her own. She had gone into the Wizard’s Rainbow. She was with Theresa O’Shyven, whose cottage had the cleanest corners in all Mejis. Mayhap in all Mid-World.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Hurry, woman!” Rhea half-screamed. “Get to yer housework!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As if hearing, Theresa unbuttoned her housedress, stepped out of it, and laid it neatly over a chair. She pulled the hem of her clean, mended shift up over her knees, went to the corner, and got down on all fours.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“That’s it, my <i class="calibre">corazón</i>!” Rhea cried, nearly choking on a phlegmy mixture of coughing and laughter. “Do yer chores, now, and do em wery pert!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Theresa O’Shyven poked her head forward to the full length of her neck, opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue, and began to lick the corner. She lapped it as Musty lapped his milk. Rhea watched this, slapping her knee and whooping, her face growing redder and redder as she rocked from side to side. Oh, Theresa was her favorite, aye! No doubt! For hours now she would crawl about on her hands and knees with her ass in the air, licking into the corners, praying to some obscure god—not even the Man-Jesus God—for forgiveness of who knew what as she did this, her penance. Sometimes she got splinters in her tongue and had to pause to spit blood into the kitchen basin. Up until now some sixth sense had always gotten her to her feet and back into her dress before any of her family returned, but Rhea knew that sooner or later the woman’s obsession would take her too far, and she would be <a id="page-507"></a>surprised. Perhaps today would be the day—the little girl would come back early, perhaps for a coin to spend in town, and discover her mother down on her knees and licking the corners. Oh, what a spin and raree! How Rhea wanted to see it! How she longed to—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Suddenly Theresa O’Shyven was gone. The interior of her neat little cottage was gone. <i class="calibre">Everything</i> was gone, lost in curtains of shifting pink light. For the first time in weeks, the wizard’s glass had gone blank.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Rhea picked the ball up in her scrawny, long-nailed fingers and shook it. “What’s wrong with you, plaguey thing? <i class="calibre">What’s wrong?</i>”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The ball was heavy, and Rhea’s strength was fading. After two or three hard shakes, it slipped in her grip. She cradled it against the deflated remains of her breasts, trembling.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No, no, lovey,” she crooned. “Come back when ye’re ready, aye, Rhea lost her temper a bit but she’s got it back now, she never meant to shake ye and she’d never <i class="calibre">ever</i> drop ye, so ye just—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She broke off and cocked her head, listening. Horses approaching. No, not approaching; <i class="calibre">here.</i> Three riders, by the sound. They had crept up on her while she was distracted.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The boys? Those plaguey boys?</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Rhea held the ball against her bosom, eyes wide, lips wet. Her hands were now so thin that the ball’s pink glow shone through them, faintly illuminating the dark spokes that were her bones.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Rhea! Rhea of the Cöos!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">No, not the boys.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Come out here, and bring what you were given!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Worse.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Farson wants his property! We’ve come to take it!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Not the boys but the Big Coffin Hunters.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Never, ye dirty old white-haired prick,” she whispered. “Ye’ll never take it.” Her eyes moved from side to side in small, shooting peeks. Scraggle-headed and tremble-mouthed, she looked like a diseased coyote driven into its final arroyo.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She looked down at the ball and a whining noise began to escape her. Now even the pink glow was gone. The sphere was as dark as a corpse’s eyeball.</p>
  <a id="page-508">

  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">A shriek came from the hut.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Depape turned to Jonas with wide eyes, his skin prickling. The thing which had uttered that cry hardly sounded human.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Rhea!” Jonas called again. “Bring it out here now, woman, and hand it over! I’ve no time to play games with you!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The door of the hut swung open. Depape and Reynolds drew their guns as the old crone stepped out, blinking against the sunlight like something that’s spent its whole life in a cave. She was holding John Farson’s favorite toy high over her head. There were plenty of rocks in the dooryard she could throw it against, and even if her aim was bad and she missed them all, it might smash anyway.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">This could be bad, and Jonas knew it—there were some people you just couldn’t threaten. He had focused so much of his attention on the brats (who, ironically, had been taken as easy as milk) that it had never occurred to him to worry much about this part of it. And Kimba Rimer, the man who had suggested Rhea as the perfect custodian for Maerlyn’s Rainbow, was dead. Couldn’t lay it at Rimer’s doorstep if things went wrong up here, could he?</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Then, just to make things a little worse when he’d have thought they’d gone as far west as they could without dropping off the cold end of the earth, he heard the cocking sound of Depape drawing the hammer of his gun.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Put that away, you idiot!” he snarled.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“But look at her!” Depape almost moaned. “<i class="calibre">Look</i> at her, Eldred!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He <i class="calibre">was</i>. The thing inside the black dress appeared to be wearing the corpse of a putrefying snake around its throat for a necklace. She was so scrawny that she resembled nothing so much as a walking skeleton. Her peeling skull was only tufted with hair; the rest had fallen out. Sores clustered on her cheeks and brow, and there was a mark like a spider-bite on the left side of her mouth. Jonas thought that last might be a scurvy-bloom, but he didn’t really care one way or another. What he cared about was the ball upraised in the dying woman’s long and shivering claws.</p>
  <a id="page-509">

   <b class="calibre1">11</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The sunlight so dazzled Rhea’s eyes that she didn’t see the gun pointed at her, and when her vision cleared, Depape had put it away again. She looked at the men lined up across from her—the bespectacled redhead, the one in the cloak, and Old White-Hair Jonas—and uttered a dusty croak of laughter. Had she been afraid of them, these mighty Coffin Hunters? She supposed she had, but for gods’ sake, why? They were men, that was all, just more men, and she had been beating such all her life. Oh, they thought they ruled the roost, all right—nobody in Mid-World accused anyone of forgetting the face of his <i class="calibre">mother</i>—but they were poor things, at bottom, moved to tears by a sad song, utterly undone by the sight of a bare breast, and all the more capable of being manipulated simply because they were so sure they were strong and tough and wise.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The glass was dark, and as much as she hated that darkness, it had cleared her mind.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Jonas!” she cried. “Eldred Jonas!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’m here, old mother,” he said. “Long days and pleasant nights.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Never mind yer sops, time’s too short for em.” She came four steps farther and stopped with the ball still held over her head. Near her, a gray chunk of stone jutted from the weedy ground. She looked at it, then back at Jonas. The implication was unspoken but unmistakable.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What do you want?” Jonas asked.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“The ball’s gone dark,” she said, answering from the side. “All the time I had it in my keeping, it was lively—aye, even when it showed nothing I could make out, it was passing lively, bright and pink—but it fell dark almost at the sound of yer voice. It doesn’t want to go with ye.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Nevertheless, I’m under orders to take it.” Jonas’s voice became soft and conciliating. It wasn’t the tone he used when he was in bed with Coral, but it was close. “Think a minute, and you’ll see my situation. Farson wants it, and who am I to stand against the wants of a man who’ll be the most powerful in Mid-World when Demon Moon rises next year? If I come back without it and say Rhea of the Cöos refused me it, I’ll be killed.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“If ye come back and tell him I broke it in yer ugly old face, ye’ll be killed, too,” Rhea said. She was close enough <a id="page-510"></a>for Jonas to see how far her sickness had eaten into her. Above the few remaining tufts of her hair, the wretched ball was trembling back and forth. She wouldn’t be able to hold it much longer. A minute at most. Jonas felt a dew of sweat spring out on his forehead.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye, mother. But d’you know, given a choice of deaths, I’d choose to take the cause of my problem with me. That’s you, darling.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She croaked again—that dusty replica of laughter—and nodded appreciatively. “ ’Twon’t do Farson any good without me in any case,” she said. “It’s found its mistress, I wot—that’s why it went dark at the sound of yer voice.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas wondered how many others had believed the ball was just for them. He wanted to wipe the sweat from his brow before it ran in his eyes, but kept his hands in front of him, folded neatly on the horn of his saddle. He didn’t dare look at either Reynolds or Depape, and could only hope they would leave the play to him. She was balanced on both a physical and mental knife-edge; the smallest movement would send her tumbling off in one direction or the other.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Found the one it wants, has it?” He thought he saw a way out of this. If he was lucky. And it might be lucky for her, as well. “What should we do about that?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Take me with ye.” Her face twisted into an expression of gruesome greed; she looked like a corpse that is trying to sneeze. <i class="calibre">She doesn’t realize she’s dying,</i> Jonas thought. <i class="calibre">Thank the gods for that.</i> “Take the ball, but take me, as well. I’ll go with ye to Farson. I’ll become his soothsayer, and nothing will stand before us, not with me to read the ball for him. Take me with ye!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right,” Jonas said. It was what he had hoped for. “Although what Farson decides is none o’ mine. You know that?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Good. Now give me the ball. I’ll give it back into your keeping, if you like, but I need to make sure it’s whole.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She slowly lowered it. Jonas didn’t think it was entirely safe even cradled in her arms, but he breathed a little easier when it was, all the same. She shuffled toward him, and he had to control an urge to gig his horse back from her.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He bent over in the saddle, holding his hands out for the glass. She looked up at him, her old eyes still shrewd behind their crusted lids. One of them actually drew down in a <a id="page-511"></a>conspirator’s wink. “I know yer mind, Jonas. Ye think, ‘I’ll take the ball, then draw my gun and kill her, what harm?’ Isn’t that true? Yet there <i class="calibre">would</i> be harm, and all to you and yours. Kill me and the ball will never shine for Farson again. For someone, aye, someday, mayhap; but not for him . . . and will he let ye live if ye bring his toy back and he discovers it’s broken?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Jonas had already considered this. “We have a bargain, old mother. You go west with the glass . . . unless you die beside the trail some night. You’ll pardon me for saying so, but you don’t look well.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She cackled. “I’m better’n I look, oh yar! Years left ’fore this clock o’ mine runs down!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">I think you may be wrong about that, old mother,</i> Jonas thought. But he kept his peace and only held his hands out for the ball.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">For a moment longer she held it. Their arrangement was made and agreed to on both sides, but in the end she could barely bring herself to ungrasp the ball. Greed shone in her eyes like moonlight through fog.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He held his hands out patiently, saying nothing, waiting for her mind to accept reality—if she let go, there was some chance. If she held on, very likely everyone in this stony, weedy yard would end up riding the handsome before long.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">With a sigh of regret, she finally put the ball in his hands. At the instant it passed from her to him, an ember of pink light pulsed deep in the depths of the glass. A throb of pain drove into Jonas’s head . . . and a shiver of lust coiled in his balls.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">As from a great distance, he heard Depape and Reynolds cocking their pistols.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Put those away,” Jonas said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“But—” Reynolds looked confused.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They thought’ee was going to double-cross Rhea,” the old woman said, cackling. “Good thing ye’re in charge rather than them, Jonas . . . mayhap you know summat they don’t.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He knew something, all right—how dangerous the smooth, glassy thing in his hands was. It could take him in a blink, if it wanted. And in a month, he would be like the witch: scrawny, raddled with sores, and too obsessed to know or care.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“Put them away!”</i> he shouted.</p>
  <a id="page-512">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">Reynolds and Depape exchanged a glance, then reholstered their guns.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“There was a bag for this thing,” Jonas said. “A drawstring bag laid inside the box. Get it.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye,” Rhea said, grinning unpleasantly at him. “But it won’t keep the ball from takin ye if it wants to. Ye needn’t think it will.” She surveyed the other two, and her eye fixed on Reynolds. “There’s a cart in my shed, and a pair of good gray goats to pull it.” She spoke to Reynolds, but her eyes kept turning back to the ball, Jonas noticed . . . and now <i class="calibre">his</i> damned eyes wanted to go there, too.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You don’t give me orders,” Reynolds said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No, but <i class="calibre">I</i> do,” Jonas said. His eyes dropped to the ball, both wanting and fearing to see that pink spark of life deep inside. Nothing. Cold and dark. He dragged his gaze back up to Reynolds again. “Get the cart.”</p>

  <p class="para-flush">Reynolds heard the buzzing of flies even before he slipped through the shed’s sagging door, and knew at once that Rhea’s goats had finished their days of pulling. They lay bloated and dead in their pen, legs sticking up and the sockets of their eyes squirming with maggots. It was impossible to know when Rhea had last fed and watered them, but Reynolds guessed at least a week, from the smell.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Too busy watching what goes on in that glass ball to bother,</i> he thought. <i class="calibre">And what’s she wearing that dead snake around her neck for?</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I don’t want to know,” he muttered from behind his pulled-up neckerchief. The only thing he <i class="calibre">did</i> want right now was to get the hell out of here.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He spied the cart, which was painted black and overlaid with cabalistic designs in gold. It looked like a medicine-show wagon to Reynolds; it also looked a bit like a hearse. He seized it by the handles and dragged it out of the shed as fast as he could. Depape could do the rest, by gods. Hitch his horse to the cart and haul the old woman’s stinking freight to . . . where? Who knew? Eldred, maybe.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Rhea came tottering out of her hut with the drawstring bag they’d brought the ball in, but she stopped, head cocked, listening, when Reynolds asked his question.</p>

  <p class="para-indent">Jonas thought it over, then said: “Seafront to begin, I guess. Yar, that’ll do for her, and this glass bauble as well, I reckon, until the party’s over tomorrow.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye, Seafront, I’ve never been there,” Rhea said, moving forward again. When she reached Jonas’s horse (which tried to shy away from her), she opened the bag. After a moment’s further consideration, Jonas dropped the ball in. It bulged round at the bottom, making a shape like a teardrop.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Rhea wore a sly smile. “Mayhap we’ll meet Thorin. If so, I might have something to show him in the Good Man’s toy that’d interest him ever so much.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“If you meet him,” Jonas said, getting down to help hitch Depape’s horse to the black cart, “it’ll be in a place where no magic is needed to see far.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She looked at him, frowning, and then the sly smile slowly resurfaced. “Why, I b’lieve our Mayor’s met wiv a accident!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Could be,” Jonas agreed.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She giggled, and soon the giggle turned into a full-throated cackle. She was still cackling as they drew out of the yard, cackling and sitting in the little black cart with its cabalistic decorations like the Queen of Black Places on her throne.</p>
