  <p class="para-flush">Now the Huntress “filled her belly,” as the old-timers said—even at noon she could be glimpsed in the sky, a pallid vampire woman caught in bright autumn sunlight. In front of businesses such as the Travellers’ Rest and on the porches of such large ranch houses as Lengyll’s Rocking B and Renfrew’s Lazy Susan, stuffy-guys with heads full of straw above their old overalls began to appear. Each wore his <i class="calibre">sombrero</i>; each held a basket of produce cradled in his arms; each looked out at the emptying world with stitched white-cross eyes.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Wagons filled with squashes clogged the roads; bright orange drifts of pumpkins and bright magenta drifts of sharproot lay against the sides of barns. In the fields, the potato-carts rolled and the pickers followed behind. In front of the Hambry Mercantile, reap-charms appeared like magic, hanging from the carved Guardians like wind-chimes.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">All over Mejis, girls sewed their Reaping Night costumes (and sometimes wept over them, if the work went badly) as they dreamed of the boys they would dance with in the Green Heart pavillion. Their little brothers began to have trouble sleeping as they thought of the rides and the games and the prizes they might win at the carnival. Even their elders sometimes lay awake in spite of their sore hands and aching backs, thinking about the pleasures of the Reap.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Summer had slipped away with a final flirt of her greengown; harvest-time had arrived.</p>

  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Rhea cared not a fig for Reaping dances or carnival games, but she could no more sleep than those who did. Most nights she lay on her stinking pallet until dawn, her skull thudding with rage. On a night not long after Jonas’s conversation with Chancellor Rimer, she determined to drink herself into oblivion. Her mood was not improved when she found that her <i class="calibre">graf</i> barrel was almost empty; she blistered the air with her curses.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She was drawing in breath for a fresh string of them when an idea struck her. A wonderful idea. A <i class="calibre">brilliant</i> idea. She had wanted Susan Delgado to cut off her hair. That hadn’t worked, and she didn’t know why . . . but she did know <i class="calibre">something</i> about the girl, didn’t she? Something interesting, aye, so it was, wery interesting, indeed.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Rhea had no desire to go to Thorin with what she knew; she had a fond (and foolish, likely) hope that the Mayor had forgotten about his wonderful glass ball. But the girl’s aunt, now . . . suppose Cordelia Delgado were to discover that not only was her niece’s virginity lost, the girl was well on her way to becoming a practiced trollop? Rhea didn’t think Cordelia would go to the Mayor, either—the woman was a prig but not a fool—yet it would set the cat among the pigeons just the same, wouldn’t it?</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">“Waow!”</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">Thinking of cats, there was Musty, standing on the stoop in the moonlight, looking at her with a mixture of hope and mistrust. Rhea, grinning hideously, opened her arms. “Come to me, my precious! Come, my sweet one!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Musty, understanding all was forgiven, rushed into his mistress’s arms and began to purr loudly as Rhea licked along his sides with her old and yellowing tongue. That night the Cöos slept soundly for the first time in a week, and when she took the glass ball into her arms the following morning, its mists cleared for her at once. She spent the day in thrall to it, spying on people she detested, drinking little and eating nothing. Around sunset, she came out of her trance enough to realize she had as yet done nothing about the saucy little jade. But that was all right; she saw how it <i class="calibre">could</i> be done . . . and she could watch all the results in the glass! All the protests, all the shouting and recriminations! She would see Susan’s tears. That would be the best, to see her tears.</p>
  <a id="page-372">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“A little harvest of my own,” she said to Ermot, who now came slithering up her leg toward the place where she liked him best. There weren’t many men who could do you like Ermot could do you, no indeed. Sitting there with a lapful of snake, Rhea began to laugh.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">

  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">“Remember your promise,” Alain said nervously as they heard the approaching beat of Rusher’s hoofs. “Keep your temper.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I will,” Cuthbert said, but he had his doubts. As Roland rode around the long wing of the bunkhouse and into the yard, his shadow trailing out in the sunset light, Cuthbert clenched his hands nervously. He willed them to open, and they did. Then, as he watched Roland dismount, they rolled themselves closed again, the nails digging into his palms.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Another go-round,</i> Cuthbert thought. <i class="calibre">Gods, but I’m sick of them. Sick to death.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Last night’s had been about the pigeons—again. Cuthbert wanted to use one to send a message back west about the oil tankers; Roland still did not. So they had argued. Except (here was another thing which infuriated him, that rubbed against his nerves like the sound of the thinny) Roland did not argue. These days Roland did not <i class="calibre">deign</i> to argue. His eyes always kept that distant look, as if only his body was here. The rest of him—mind, soul, spirit, <i class="calibre">ka</i>—was with Susan Delgado.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No,” he had said simply. “It’s too late for such.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You can’t know that,” Cuthbert had argued. “And even if it’s too late for <i class="calibre">help</i> to come from Gilead, it’s not too late for <i class="calibre">advice</i> to come from Gilead. Are you so blind you can’t see that?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What advice can they send us?” Roland hadn’t seemed to hear the rawness in Cuthbert’s voice. His own voice was calm. Reasonable. And utterly disconnected, Cuthbert thought, from the urgency of the situation.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“If we knew that,” he had replied, “we wouldn’t have to ask, Roland, would we?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We can only wait and stop them when they make their move. It’s comfort you’re looking for, Cuthbert, not advice.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">You mean wait while you fuck her in as many ways and in as many places as you can imagine,</i> Cuthbert thought. <i class="calibre">Inside, outside, rightside up and upside down.</i></p>
  <a id="page-373">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“You’re not thinking clearly about this,” Cuthbert had said coldly. He’d heard Alain’s gasp. Neither of them had ever said such a thing to Roland in their lives, and once it was out, he’d waited uneasily for whatever explosion might follow.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">None did. “Yes,” Roland replied, “I am.” And he had gone into the bunkhouse without another word.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Now, watching Roland uncinch Rusher’s girths and pull the saddle from his back, Cuthbert thought: <i class="calibre">You’re not, you know. But you better think clearly about this. By all the gods, you’d better.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Hile,” he said as Roland carried the saddle over to the porch and set it on the step. “Busy afternoon?” He felt Alain kick his ankle and ignored it.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’ve been with Susan,” Roland said. No defense, no demur, no excuse. And for a moment Cuthbert had a vision of shocking clarity: he saw the two of them in a hut somewhere, the late afternoon sun shining through holes in the roof and dappling their bodies. She was on top, riding him. Cuthbert saw her knees on the old, spongy boards, and the tension in her long thighs. He saw how tanned her arms were, how white her belly. He saw how Roland’s hands cupped the globes of her breasts, squeezing them as she rocked back and forth above him, and he saw how the sun lit her hair, turning it into a fine-spun net.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Why do you always have to be first?</i> he cried at Roland in his mind. <i class="calibre">Why does it always have to be you? Gods damn you, Roland! Gods damn you!</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We were on the docks,” Cuthbert said, his tone a thin imitation of his usual brightness. “Counting boots and marine tools and what are called clam-drags. What an amusing time of it we’ve had, eh, Al?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Did you need me to help you do that?” Roland asked. He went back to Rusher, and took off the saddle-blanket. “Is that why you sound angry?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“If I sound angry, it’s because most of the fishermen are laughing at us behind our backs. We keep coming back and coming back. Roland, they think we’re fools.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland nodded. “All to the good,” he said.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Perhaps,” Alain said quietly, “but Rimer doesn’t think we’re fools—it’s in the way he looks at us when we pass. Nor does Jonas. And if they don’t think we’re fools, Roland, what <i class="calibre">do</i> they think?”</p>
  <a id="page-374">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland stood on the second step, the saddle-blanket hanging forgotten over his arm. For once they actually seemed to have his attention, Cuthbert thought. Glory be and will wonders never cease.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They think we’re avoiding the Drop because we already know what’s there,” Roland said. “And if they don’t think it, they soon will.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Cuthbert has a plan.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland’s gaze—mild, interested, already starting to be not there again—shifted to Cuthbert. Cuthbert the joker. Cuthbert the ’prentice, who had in no way earned the gun he’d carried east to the Outer Crescent. Cuthbert the virgin and eternal second. <i class="calibre">Gods, I don’t want to hate him. I don’t, but now it’s so easy.</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We two should go and see Sheriff Avery tomorrow,” Cuthbert said. “We will present it as a courtesy visit. We have already established ourselves as three courteous, if slightly stupid, young fellows, have we not?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“To a fault,” Roland agreed, smiling.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We’ll say that we’ve finally finished with the seacoast side of Hambry, and we hope to be every bit as meticulous on the farm and cowboy side. But we certainly don’t want to cause trouble or be in anyone’s way. It is, after all, the busiest time of year—for ranchers as well as farmers—and even citified fools such as ourselves will be aware of that. So we’ll give the good Sheriff a list—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland’s eyes lit up. He tossed the blanket over the porch rail, grabbed Cuthbert around the shoulders, and gave him a rough hug. Cuthbert could smell a lilac scent around Roland’s collar and felt an insane but powerful urge to clamp his hands around Roland’s throat and try to strangle him. Instead, he gave him a perfunctory clap on the back in return.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland drew away, grinning widely. “A list of the ranches we’ll be visiting,” he said. “Aye! And with forewarning, they can move any stock they’d like us not to see on to the next ranch, or the last one. The same for tack, feed, equipment . . . it’s masterful, Cuthbert! You’re a genius!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Far from that,” Cuthbert said. “I’ve just spared a little time to think about a problem that concerns us all. That concerns the entire Affiliation, mayhap. We <i class="calibre">need</i> to think. Wouldn’t you say?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Alain winced, but Roland didn’t seem to notice. He was <a id="page-375"></a>still grinning. Even at fourteen, such an expression on his face was troubling. The truth was that when Roland grinned, he looked slightly mad. “Do you know, they may even move in a fair number of muties for us to look at, just so we’ll continue to believe the lies they’ve already told about the impurity of their stocklines.” He paused, seeming to think, and then said: “Why don’t you and Alain go and see the Sheriff, Bert? That would do very well, I think.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">At this point Cuthbert nearly threw himself at Roland, wanting to scream <i class="calibre">Yes, why not? Then you could spend tomorrow morning pronging her as well as tomorrow afternoon! You idiot! You thoughtless lovestruck idiot!</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">It was Al who saved him—saved them all, perhaps.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Don’t be a fool,” he said sharply, and Roland wheeled toward him, looking surprised. He wasn’t used to sharpness from that quarter. “You’re our leader, Roland—seen that way by Thorin, by Avery, by the townsfolk. Seen that way by us as well.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No one appointed me—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No one needed to!” Cuthbert shouted. “You won your guns! These folk would hardly believe it—I hardly believe it myself just lately—but <i class="calibre">you are a gunslinger</i>. You have to go! Plain as the nose on your face! It doesn’t matter which of us accompanies you, but you have to go!” He could say more, much more, but if he did, where would it end? With their fellowship broken beyond repair, likely. So he clamped his mouth shut—no need for Alain to kick him this time—and once again waited for the explosion. Once again, none came.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right,” Roland said in his new way—that mild it-doesn’t-much-matter way that made Cuthbert feel like biting him to wake him up. “Tomorrow morning. You and I, Bert. Will eight suit you?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Down to the ground,” Cuthbert said. Now that the discussion was over and the decision made, Bert’s heart was beating wildly and the muscles in his upper thighs felt like rubber. It was the way he’d felt after their confrontation with the Big Coffin Hunters.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“We’ll be at our prettiest,” Roland said. “Nice boys from the Inners with good intentions but not many brains. Fine.” And he went inside, no longer grinning (which was a relief) but smiling gently.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cuthbert and Alain looked at each other and let out their <a id="page-376"></a>breath in a mutual rush. Cuthbert cocked his head toward the yard, and went down the steps. Alain followed, and the two boys stood in the center of the dirt rectangle with the bunkhouse at their backs. To the east, the rising full moon was hidden behind a scrim of clouds.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“She’s tranced him,” Cuthbert said. “Whether she means to or not, she’ll kill us all in the end. Wait and see if she don’t.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You shouldn’t say such, even in jest.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“All right, she’ll crown us with the jewels of Eld and we’ll live forever.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“You have to stop being angry at him, Bert. You <i class="calibre">have</i> to.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cuthbert looked at him bleakly. “I can’t.”</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">4</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">The great storms of autumn were still a month or more distant, but the following morning dawned drizzly and gray. Roland and Cuthbert wrapped themselves in <i class="calibre">serapes</i> and headed for town, leaving Alain to the few home place chores. Tucked in Roland’s belt was the schedule of farms and ranches—beginning with the three small spreads owned by the Barony—the three of them had worked out the previous evening. The pace this schedule suggested was almost ludicrously slow—it would keep them on the Drop and in the orchards almost until Year’s End Fair—but it conformed to the pace they had already set on the docks.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Now the two of them rode silently toward town, both lost in their own thoughts. Their way took them past the Delgado house. Roland looked up and saw Susan sitting in her window, a bright vision in the gray light of that fall morning. His heart leaped up and although he didn’t know it then, it was how he would remember her most clearly forever after—lovely Susan, the girl at the window. So do we pass the ghosts that haunt us later in our lives; they sit undramatically by the roadside like poor beggars, and we see them only from the corners of our eyes, if we see them at all. The idea that they have been waiting there for us rarely if ever crosses our minds. Yet they do wait, and when we have passed, they gather up their bundles of memory and fall in behind, treading in our footsteps and catching up, little by little.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland raised a hand to her. It went toward his mouth at first, wanting to send her a kiss, but that would be madness. <a id="page-377"></a>He lifted the hand before it could touch his lips and ticked a finger off his forehead instead, offering a saucy little salute.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan smiled and returned it in kind. None saw Cordelia, who had gone out in the drizzle to check on the last of her squash and sharproot. That lady stood where she was, a <i class="calibre">sombrera</i> yanked down on her head almost to the eyeline, half-hidden by the stuffy-guy guarding the pumpkin patch. She watched Roland and Cuthbert pass (Cuthbert she barely saw; her interest was in the other one). From the boy on horseback she looked up to Susan, sitting there in her window, humming as blithely as a bird in a gilded cage.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">A sharp splinter of suspicion whispered its way into Cordelia’s heart. Susan’s change of temperament—from alternating bouts of sorrow and fearful anger to a kind of dazed but mainly cheerful acceptance—had been so sudden. Mayhap it wasn’t acceptance at all.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Ye’re mad,” she whispered to herself, but her hand remained tight on the haft of the machete she held. She dropped to her knees in the muddy garden and abruptly began chopping sharproot vines, tossing the roots themselves toward the side of the house with quick, accurate throws. “There’s nothing between em. I’d know. Children of such an age have no more discretion than . . . than the drunks in the Rest.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">But the way they had smiled. The way they had smiled at <i class="calibre">each other</i>.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Perfectly normal,” she whispered, chopping and throwing. She cut a sharproot nearly in half, ruining it, not noticing. The whispering was a habit she’d picked up only recently, as Reap Day neared and the stresses of coping with her brother’s troublesome daughter mounted. “Folks smile at each other, that’s all.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The same for the salute and Susan’s returning wave. Below, the handsome cavalier, acknowledging the pretty maid; above, the maid herself, pleased to be acknowledged by such as he. It was youth calling to youth, that was all. And yet . . .</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">The look in his eyes . . . and the look in hers.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">Nonsense, of course. But—</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">But you saw something else.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">Yes, perhaps. For a moment it had seemed to her that the young man was going to blow Susan a kiss . . . then had remembered himself at the last moment and turned it into a salute, instead.</p>
  <a id="page-378">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Even if ye did see such a thing, it means nothing. Young cavaliers are saucy, especially when out from beneath the gaze of their fathers. And these three already have a history, as ye well know.</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">All true enough, but none of it removed that chilly splinter from her heart.</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">5</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">Jonas answered Roland’s knock and let the two boys into the Sheriff’s office. He was wearing a Deputy’s star on his shirt, and looked at them with expressionless eyes. “Boys,” he said. “Come in out of the wet.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He stepped back to allow them entrance. His limp was more pronounced than Roland had ever seen it; the wet weather was playing it up, he supposed.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland and Cuthbert stepped in. There was a gas heater in the corner—filled from “the candle” at Citgo, no doubt—and the big room, which had been cool on the day they had first come here, was stuporously hot. The three cells held five woeful-looking drunks, two pairs of men and a woman in the center cell by herself, sitting on the bunk with her legs spread wide, displaying a broad expanse of red drawers. Roland feared that if she got her finger any farther up her nose, she might never retrieve it. Clay Reynolds was leaning against the notice-board, picking his teeth with a broomstraw. Sitting at the rolltop desk was Deputy Dave, stroking his chin and frowning through his monocle at the board which had been set up there. Roland wasn’t at all surprised to see that he and Bert had interrupted a game of Castles.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Well, look here, Eldred!” Reynolds said. “It’s two of the In-World boys! Do your mommies know you’re out, fellas?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They do,” Cuthbert said brightly. “And you’re looking very well, sai Reynolds. The wet weather’s soothed your pox, has it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Without looking at Bert or losing his pleasant little smile, Roland shot an elbow into his friend’s shoulder. “Pardon my friend, sai. His humor regularly transgresses the bounds of good taste; he doesn’t seem able to help it. There’s no need for us to scratch at one another—we’ve agreed to let bygones be bygones, haven’t we?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye, certainly, all a misunderstanding,” Jonas said. He <a id="page-379"></a>limped back across to the desk and the game-board. As he sat down on his side of it, his smile turned to a sour little grimace. “I’m worse than an old dog,” he said. “Someone ought to put me down, so they should. Earth’s cold but painless, eh, boys?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He looked back at the board and moved a man around to the side of his Hillock. He had begun to Castle, and was thus vulnerable . . . although not very, in this case, Roland thought; Deputy Dave didn’t look like much in the way of competition.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I see you’re working for the Barony salt now,” Roland said, nodding at the star on Jonas’s shirt.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Salt’s what it amounts to,” Jonas said, companionably enough. “A fellow went leg-broke. I’m helping out, that’s all.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“And sai Reynolds? Sai Depape? Are they helping out as well?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yar, I reckon,” Jonas said. “How goes your work among the fisherfolk? Slow, I hear.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Done at last. The work wasn’t so slow as we were. But coming here in disgrace was enough for us—we have no intention of leaving that way. Slow and steady wins the race, they say.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“So they do,” Jonas agreed. “Whoever ‘they’ are.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">From somewhere deeper in the building there came the whoosh of a water-stool flushing. <i class="calibre">All the comforts of home in the Hambry Sheriff’s,</i> Roland thought. The flush was soon followed by heavy footsteps descending a staircase, and a few moments later, Herk Avery appeared. With one hand he was buckling his belt; with the other he mopped his broad and sweaty forehead. Roland admired the man’s dexterity.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Whew!” the Sheriff exclaimed. “Them beans I ate last night took the shortcut, I tell ye.” He looked from Roland to Cuthbert and then back to Roland. “Why, boys! Too wet for net-counting, is it?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Sai Dearborn was just saying that their net-counting days are at an end,” Jonas said. He combed back his long hair with the tips of his fingers. Beyond him, Clay Reynolds had resumed his slouch against the notice-board, looking at Roland and Cuthbert with open dislike.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Aye? Well, that’s fine, that’s fine. What’s next, youngsters? And is there any way we here can help ye? For that’s what we like to do best, lend a hand where a hand’s needed. So it is.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Actually, you <i class="calibre">could</i> help us,” Roland said. He reached <a id="page-380"></a>into his belt and pulled out the list. “We have to move on to the Drop, but we don’t want to inconvenience anyone.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Grinning hugely, Deputy Dave slid his Squire all the way around his own Hillock. Jonas Castled at once, ripping open Dave’s entire left flank. The grin faded from Dave’s face, leaving a puzzled emptiness. “How’d ye manage that?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Easy.” Jonas smiled, then pushed back from the desk to include the others in his regard. “You want to remember, Dave, that I play to win. I can’t help it; it’s just my nature.” He turned his full attention to Roland. His smile broadened. “Like the scorpion said to the maiden as she lay dying, ‘You knowed I was poison when you picked me up.’ ”</p>
  <h3 class="sub">
   <b class="calibre1">6</b>
  </h3>
  <p class="para-flush">When Susan came in from feeding the livestock, she went directly to the cold-pantry for the juice, which was her habit. She didn’t see her aunt standing in the chimney corner and watching her, and when Cordelia spoke, Susan was startled badly. It wasn’t just the unexpectedness of the voice; it was the coldness of it.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Do ye know him?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">The juice-jug slipped in her fingers, and Susan put a steadying hand beneath it. Orange juice was too precious to waste, especially this late in the year. She turned and saw her aunt by the woodbox. Cordelia had hung her <i class="calibre">sombrera</i> on a hook in the entryway, but she still wore her <i class="calibre">serape</i> and muddy boots. Her <i class="calibre">cuchillo</i> lay on top of the stacked wood, with green strands of sharproot vine still trailing from its edge. Her tone was cold, but her eyes were hot with suspicion.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">A sudden clarity filled Susan’s mind and all of her senses. <i class="calibre">If you say “No,” you’re damned,</i> she thought. <i class="calibre">If you even ask who, you may be damned. You must say—</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I know them both,” she replied in offhand fashion. “I met them at the party. So did you. Ye frightened me, Aunt.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Why did he salute ye so?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“How can I know? Perhaps he just felt like it.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Her aunt bolted forward, slipped in her muddy boots, regained her balance, and seized Susan by the arms. Now her eyes were blazing. “Be’n’t insolent with me, girl! Be’n’t haughty with me, Miss Oh So Young and Pretty, or I’ll—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan pulled backward so hard that Cordelia staggered and <a id="page-381"></a>might have fallen again, if the table had not been handy to grab. Behind her, muddy foot-tracks stood out on the clean kitchen floor like accusations. “Call me that again and I’ll . . . I’ll slap thee!” Susan cried. “So I will!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cordelia’s lips drew back from her teeth in a dry, ferocious smile. “Ye’d slap your father’s only living blood kin? Would ye be so bad?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Why not? Do ye not slap me, Aunt?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Some of the heat went out of her aunt’s eyes, and the smile left her mouth. “Susan! Hardly ever! Not half a dozen times since ye were a toddler who would grab anything her hands could reach, even a pot of boiling water on the—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“It’s with thy mouth thee mostly hits nowadays,” Susan said. “I’ve put up with it—more fool me—but am done with it now. I’ll have no more. If I’m old enough to be sent to a man’s bed for money, I’m old enough for ye to keep a civil tongue when ye speak to me.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cordelia opened her mouth to defend herself—the girl’s anger had startled her, and so had her accusations—and then she realized how cleverly she was being led away from the subject of the boys. Of the <i class="calibre">boy</i>.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Ye only know him from the party, Susan? It’s Dearborn I mean.” <i class="calibre">As I think ye well know</i>.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’ve seen him about town,” Susan said. She met her aunt’s eyes steadily, although it cost her an effort; lies would follow half-truths as dark followed dusk. “I’ve seen all three of them about town. Are ye satisfied?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">No, Susan saw with mounting dismay, she was not.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Do ye swear to me, Susan—on your father’s name—that ye’ve not been meeting this boy Dearborn?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">All the rides in the late afternoon,</i> Susan thought. <i class="calibre">All the excuses. All the care that no one should see us. And it all comes down to a careless wave on a rainy morning. That easily all’s put at risk. Did we think it could be otherwise? Were we that foolish?</i></p>
  <p class="para-indent">Yes . . . and no. The truth was they had been mad. And still were.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan kept remembering the look of her father’s eyes on the few occasions when he had caught her in a fib. That look of half-curious disappointment. The sense that her fibs, innocuous as they might be, had hurt him like the scratch of a thorn.</p>
  <a id="page-382">
  </a>
  <p class="para-indent">“I will swear to nothing,” she said. “Ye’ve no right to ask it of me.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Swear!” Cordelia cried shrilly. She groped out for the table again and grasped it, as if for balance. “Swear it! Swear it! This is no game of jacks or tag or Johnny-jump-my-pony! Thee’s not a child any longer! Swear to me! Swear that thee’re still pure!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“No,” Susan said, and turned to leave. Her heart was beating madly, but still that awful clarity informed the world. Roland would have known it for what it was: she was seeing with gunslinger’s eyes. There was a glass window in the kitchen, looking out toward the Drop, and in it she saw the ghostly reflection of Aunt Cord coming toward her, one arm raised, the hand at the end of it knotted into a fist. Without turning, Susan put up her own hand in a halting gesture. “Raise that not to me,” she said. “Raise it not, ye bitch.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">She saw the reflection’s ghost-eyes widen in shock and dismay. She saw the ghost-fist relax, become a hand again, fall to the ghost-woman’s side.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Susan,” Cordelia said in a small, hurt voice. “How can ye call me so? What’s so coarsened your tongue and your regard for me?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Susan went out without replying. She crossed the yard and entered the barn. Here the smells she had known since childhood—horses, lumber, hay—filled her head and drove the awful clarity away. She was tumbled back into childhood, lost in the shadows of her confusion again. Pylon turned to look at her and whickered. Susan put her head against his neck and cried.</p>

  <p class="para-flush">“There!” Sheriff Avery said when sais Dearborn and Heath were gone. “It’s as ye said—just slow is all they are; just creeping careful.” He held the meticulously printed list up, studied it a moment, then cackled happily. “And look at this! What a beauty! Har! We can move anything we don’t want em to see days in advance, so we can.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“They’re fools,” Reynolds said . . . but he pined for another chance at them, just the same. If Dearborn really thought bygones were bygones over that little business in the Travellers’ Rest, he was way past foolishness and dwelling in the land of idiocy.</p>
  <a id="page-383">

  <p class="para-indent">Deputy Dave said nothing. He was looking disconsolately through his monocle at the Castles board, where his white army had been laid waste in six quick moves. Jonas’s forces had poured around Red Hillock like water, and Dave’s hopes had been swept away in the flood.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’m tempted to wrap myself up dry and go over to Seafront with this,” Avery said. He was still gloating over the paper, with its neat list of farms and ranches and proposed dates of inspection. Up to Year’s End and beyond it ran. Gods!</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Why don’t ye do that?” Jonas said, and got to his feet. Pain ran up his leg like bitter lightning.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Another game, sai Jonas?” Dave asked, beginning to reset the pieces.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“I’d rather play a weed-eating dog,” Jonas said, and took malicious pleasure at the flush that crept up Dave’s neck and stained his guileless fool’s face. He limped across to the door, opened it, and went out on the porch. The drizzle had become a soft, steady rain. Hill Street was deserted, the cobbles gleaming wetly.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Reynolds had followed him out. “Eldred—”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Get away,” Jonas said without turning.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Clay hesitated a moment, then went back inside and closed the door.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">What the hell’s wrong with you?</i> Jonas asked himself.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">He should have been pleased at the two young pups and their list—as pleased as Avery was, as pleased as Rimer would be when he heard about this morning’s visit. After all, hadn’t he told Rimer not three days ago that the boys would soon be over on the Drop, counting their little hearts out? Yes. So why did he feel so unsettled? So fucking jittery? Because there still hadn’t been any contact from Farson’s man, Latigo? Because Reynolds came back empty from Hanging Rock on one day and Depape came back empty the next? Surely not. Latigo would come, along with a goodly troop of men, but it was still too soon for them, and Jonas knew it. Reaping was still almost a month away.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">So is it just the bad weather working on your leg, stirring up that old wound and making you ugly?</i>
  </p>
  <p class="para-indent">No. The pain was bad, but it had been worse before. The trouble was his head. Jonas leaned against a post beneath the overhang, listened to the rain plinking on the tiles, and thought how, sometimes in a game of Castles, a clever player <a id="page-384"></a>would peek around his Hillock for just a moment, then duck back. That was what this felt like—it was so right it smelled wrong. Crazy idea, but somehow not crazy at all.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Are you trying to play Castles with me, sprat?” Jonas murmured. “If so, you’ll soon wish you’d stayed home with your mommy. So you will.”</p>

  <p class="para-flush">Roland and Cuthbert headed back to the Bar K along the Drop—there would be no counting done today. At first, in spite of the rain and the gray skies, Cuthbert’s good humor was almost entirely restored.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Did you see them?” he asked with a laugh. “Did you see them, Roland . . . Will, I mean? They bought it, didn’t they? Swallowed that honey whole, they did!”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“Yes.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">“What do we do next? What’s our next move?”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Roland looked at him blankly for a moment, as if startled out of a doze. “The next move is theirs. We count. And we wait.”</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Cuthbert’s good cheer collapsed in a puff, and he once more found himself having to restrain a flood of recrimination, all whirling around two basic ideas: that Roland was shirking his duty so he could continue to wallow in the undeniable charms of a certain young lady, and—more important—that Roland had lost his wits when all of Mid-World needed them the most.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">Except what duty was Roland shirking? And what made him so sure Roland was wrong? Logic? Intuition? Or just shitty old catbox jealousy? Cuthbert found himself thinking of the effortless way Jonas had ripped up Deputy Dave’s army when Deputy Dave had moved too soon. But life was not like Castles . . . was it? He didn’t know. But he thought he had at least one valid intuition: Roland was heading for disaster. And so they all were.</p>
  <p class="para-indent">
   <i class="calibre">Wake up,</i> Cuthbert thought. <i class="calibre">Please, Roland, wake up before it’s too late.</i></p>
